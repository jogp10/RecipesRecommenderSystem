I can't stop eating it, and I've eaten myself into a food coma. 4 Stars The recipe is wonderful as is. I can't think of a single improvement and I will most likely make it again. 3 Stars This needed a little *something*something*. I might make it again, but will add my own improvements if I do. I love to eat! And I love to cook. I tend to take over the kitchen when I get in there. Even the dog knows the command get outta my kitchen! LOL. Cooking for other people and trying new recipes or foods is FUN! I have a small (but growing quickly!!) cookbook collection and one of my favorite things to do is to read recipes and plan meals. Rachael Ray, Horn of the Moon and Moosewood are favorites of mine. We spend a lot of time outdoors camping, hiking and backpacking. Yup. I cook in the woods too!

As for my cooking philosophy, I like easy things that might take a long time to cook, but only need occasional tending (like bread or dals). Lately, I've been very interested in healthy substitutions to make dishes with less fat and/or more fiber. I've been experimenting with making tasty recipes that are free of processed sugars and flour. Since moving to China, I've found myself without an oven and without access to common ingredients, like Bisquick and vanilla ext., so I'm currently looking for breads or cakes that I can cook in a crockpot.

We have 22 acres outside several small farming/ranching/oil communities, with 1-1/2 acre pond, 5 big dogs that swim the waters (and 1 who's old and sleeps all day inside), and a mama doe who has a set of twins each year. I'm a movie enthusiast and my passion is writing (novels and screenplays). Over the past 2 years I've picked up painting and love it. When my kids are out of college in 6 years, my husband and I plan to travel extensively. I'd love to relocate temporarily to different ares of the USA and world, just so I can absorb the culture (and write about them). My whole life has been centered around food to show love and to socialize, so when I travel I'll search for the best foods and absorb the richness of the people. In the book Beach Music by Pat Conroy, you can taste the foods and drinks of the piazzas in Rome down to the detail of the Southern cuisine in S. Carolina. When I grow up, I want to write as beautifully as Mr. Conroy. My favorite cookbooks are those put together as church or other fundraisers. There's nothing better than a church potluck dinner, so you're almost gauranteed excellent recipes. I love cooking but hate the clean up, so my plans are when I earn the publishing $$big bucks$$, I'll hire a full-time housekeeper so I may cook to my heart's delight and not get frustrated over a messy kitchen. I love experimenting and trying new recipes, but my DH is a meat & potatoes man, thus prefers the basics. One of my children has been a self-professed vegetarian for 11 years, making dinner time a real treat to prepare. I've read somewhere that your pet peeve is usually something of which you're frequently guilty, so I'm a little hesitant to say; however, mine would be inconsiderate people.

Due to unfortunate circumstances and God's grace, we are raising our two beautiful grandchildren from our daughter, Chris, who lost her battle with breast cancer after a hard, four year battle. It is a responsibility that I do not take lightly. God has blessed us with these kids and it is an honor to be able to raise them. That's not to say, it's easy. Organization is the key. We do lots of meal planning and advance preparation. Evan & I enjoy eating out at fine restaurants and then trying to re-create gourmet meals at home. Unfortunately (?) we are such good cooks that we are usually disappointed when eating out because we know that what we prepare tastes better (and less expensive). Therefore, we usually only order something that we haven't made at home. We love to cook together and spend many hours cooking for family and friends. Quite honestly, Evan is the better cook in the family. He has a knack for knowing what flavors and spices blend well together and has created many original creations. I love to find and try out new recipes - which is why I visit Recipezaar often. We've added many of your shared recipes to my public cookbook titled Permanent Edition. I only post recipes that are our favorites and feel that others will enjoy them. I look for ease of preparation AND outstanding flavor.

If something really works for me, I post it. A lot of my favorite recipes are copy cat. I would much rather make something I love from a restaurant than actually go. I make Alice Springs Chicken monthly and Cottage Cheese pancakes at least 4 times a month. Those two recipes will never get old in this house.

I have 4 kids, who are the loves of my life and cooking for them and my husband keeps me on my toes! ;) We bought an ice cream parlor in March 04 and it's been quite an experience! Note: I love getting feedback on my recipes; all I ask is that you actually *make* them before reviewing them. Also, if you make changes or substitutions, I'd love to see your suggestions and/or comments, but I'd appreciate no rating at all if it's not made as posted. Too many recipe reviews state margarine subbed for butter (if I list butter, it's REAL butter), different spices, low-fat ingredients, whole wheat flour instead of white, etc. The recipes will not work/taste as intended, so it's really not fair to rate them as such. I'd also really appreciate it if you refrain from rating a recipe if you overcook or overbake it or it you don't refrigerate or store as listed. I, of course, will adhere to the above when rating recipes, too! Thanks and have a great day! My Rating System: ***** A delicious recipe that was thoroughly enjoyed. It has excellent, detailed directions and is perfect as is. If a dish is especially easy, and I'm on the fence, I will give it 5* for ease even if it's very good instead of great. Something I will definitely make again. **** Excellent recipe but confusing directions that I will make again in my own less confusing way OR Very good recipe that I'll probably make again if I find the time! *** Good/OK recipe but probably not something I would make again OR Very Good recipe that doesn't have clear, detailed directions. ** Recipe was edible but not really enjoyed and will not be made again. Work involved not a good trade-off for the end result. * Not edible and probably an error in the recipe.

I do try to explain myself in my reviews and welcome any questions or comments on what I have said. It is not my intention to be mean-spirited if I did not like something (it is rare for me not to like a recipe though):) Recipezaar brings such a nice element to my life and I feel it has been enriched by the wealth of knowledge both in everyone's contributed recipes and on the forums.

I go on food jags and cooking jags! Please come say hi to me and chat on facebook. I currently host a blog for saving money through finding deals and coupons if you are interested. Most of the time I try to cook and have a good dinner on the table but I'll be honest enough to say there is still fast food occasionally in the budget! I have had such wonderful support here whenever I need it. Thank you all for being here! Just a quick note on how I rate recipes: ? 5 stars - This recipe is perfect. (My DH is truly a critic and doesn't give 5's unless it's amazing) I would recommend it to others and would definitely make again. ? 4 stars - This recipe was good but I would change something in it next time. ? 3 stars - This is a recipe I would not make again but it was OK ? 2 stars - This recipe I would not make again and we didn't like it at all ? 1 star - This recipes did not work out/taste was unappealing and wouldn't make again,Contributor,4.4,"Las Vegas, Nevada",2000-11-01,4,308,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/burger.png,874

84633,496803,https://www.food.com/user/496803,IngridH,"I live near Seattle, WA with my husband of 11 years and our pet ferrets. We're lucky enough to own a home with a big, south facing yard which is great for entertaining. It also allows me to have a big vegetable garden where I grow most of my own herbs and a lot of the vegetables we eat in the summer, as well as a bunch to share with family and friends. In my professional life, I'm an accountant- but what I really love to do is cook and eat! Most of my ability is self-taught. I love to experiment with new recipes and techniques, most of which I get from watching way too much food tv and reading foodie magazines. Recently I decided to start a personal chef business and have cooked for a few clients. I love the challenge of designing a menu to fit a family's specific tastes and needs, and then cooking it for them to enjoy. For me, cooking is an expression of love. Everyone needs to eat, but food is more than just fuel for the body, it can nurture and comfort ~ give us a memory from childhood, or a retreat when we feel ill. I always think of the people who I'm cooking for when I make a dish, and there is no better compliment than when someone enjoys the food I've made especially for them. I also like to do OAMC- style cooking, but instead of using it mainly to get dinner on the table, I focus on getting lunch in the bag! Eating out is far too expensive in both dollars and nutrition to make a habit of, yet I want a hot, satisfying meal to enjoy in the middle of the day. Cookin ahead allows me to have great food, without sacrificing either my dollars or my waistline.

I married my wonderful and handsome husband, Sean, in August 2007. He is becoming a wonderful gardender and tends to both our veggie and herb gardens. We really enjoy cooking with our own fresh ingredients. We most often cook together, so my reviews typically reflect our joint opinions. He's the better cook, so I pick up a lot of my techniques from him. My other interests include reading (now that I have time), Irish dancing (I've taken a class for the last several years), ""appreciating"" wine (I use the term very loosely), and listening to and going to see Irish bands (I love the Pogues). I also enjoy travelling, especially around Western Europe, where I have been multiple times. One of my favorite places is Italy, and Sean and I had a great time on our honeymoon eating, drinking, and sightseeing in the Cinque Terre and in Tuscany. This July 2009, we expanded our horizons to Eastern Europe and visited the Czech Republic, Slovenia, and Croatia. Two of my favorite dishes on the trip were Croatian: fish brodet and Hvarska gregada. I am looking forward to trying my hand at making them at home as I see that someone on Zaar, who is Croatian, posted recipes for both! Besides my husband, the other lights of my life are my cats: Chloe, Pip, and my newest ragdoll cat, Giselle, all of whom I absolutely adore.

84641,232669,https://www.food.com/user/232669,Manami,"Hello all, thank you for visiting My Page but forgive me for it is a work in progress! :) As I am sure you have noticed I changed my Chef Name to Manami which means love & beauty. ;) Just thought I should get with the program - my geisha & my icon! :) Don't fret, I won't change it again! I am 70 years young and I live in a nursing home, which is out of this world, I am treated like a princess and the world is my oyster! I have a private room and during the season I do taxes for most of the staff, as well as my personal clients that have been following me since I left the business world about 25 years ago. I was rear-ended by a van and it turned my whole world upside down. Why dwell on that? I am an American Jew (from NYC) who moved to Havana, Cuba when I was 2 1/2 years old, lived there until a few days after Castro took over and vamoosed it out of that country as fast as my legs would carry me! I was on a forced hiatus from the UofM, due to illness. From there my sister, mother and I went to NYC to work and my father went to Haiti in Port-Au-Prince, where he and my uncle had purchased some tiny cocoa plantations & a chocolate factory - for the choccolate liquer - to make baking chocolate (the real bitter stuff). We joined my father about 2 months later where I spent 2 of the most carefree & wonderful years of my life! It is the stuff that movies are made of! (A la Grace Kelly - even my clothes were like hers)>  I then continued my studies in upstate NY and hated it because it was too, too cold!:( Went back to NYC to work and see what I wanted to do with my life - I was all of 20 years old and had to drop out of school because of illness and then because of the weather! Yuck - so I got a job in a Textile Buying Office as a receptionist and soon I found myself buying trimmings! Loved it and was very happy with the work I was doing. However, I got an offer from two young guys who had a factory in Cleveland, Ohio, where they made Maternity Clothes and they wanted me to be in charge of the shipping dept, keep inventory and in my spare time - help with the designing!! I couldn't pass it up - the offer sounded so great and the salary was twice what I was making in the NYC. So I went to Cleveland, got married, had both my children and got a divorce 15 years later. Then my children and I moved to South Florida and have been here since 1978, I can't count that far back :) Learned how to do taxes with H&R Block and worked simultaneously as a Supervisor in 2 offices for them for 15 years. Then after the accident everything went spiralling downwards until I could no longer walk alone even with a walker - so the next step was a wheelchair. Stayed at home with a lot of help (nurses, PT therapists) fixed the bathroom so I could bathe myself and fixed the kitchen so I could help warm-up meals (was taught how to cook in rehab) and so forth and so on. However, the fire department had other plans for me, I called them too often to pick me up off the floor - how embarassing! So they gave me a choice - either a home or they would have to call HRS! :( (very sad) It was there, in my home where I was robbed!  All my cookbooks (all my Julia Childs Cookbooks, my Settlement Cookbook which had been my mothers - published in 1939 - with all her notes) my mother's cookbooks from Cuba & Haiti, all my handwritten recipes. They also took all my Delft collection, some antiques that I had in the kitchen like my rolling pin, a beautiful old & used wooden bowl, a charcoal-iron that was brought north when my parents left Haiti, it was hand-painted & was gorgeous, as well as all the other things that are too numerous to mention! That proved to be the last straw & from there it was an ALF, which was horrible, and then on to another home where the administrator of that home became the administrator here and voila, here I am. I have a beautiful large private room with a private bath, furnished to my liking: eclectic!  My room is large enough to house my office and all the other odds and ends with which I like to surround myself. During tax season, mostly, my room is always full (of course I love it that way)! I have a blanket my daughter bought for me in New Mexico and that is on my bed. You guessed it - that is where everbody sits or on my great grandfather's arm chair which is in great shape.  Update 01/11/2008 that time is here again :) Have started doing taxes already and not just regular taxes but corporations, partnerships and 1040X - ammended returns! Whoopee! I love the feeling I get when this time comes around and I get into gear!!! I love it! :) The head chef, the kitchen supervisor & the dietician enjoy the recipes from Zaar; the ones that I post, as well as, the others. We are in the process of changing the menu right now - so we have been doing a lot of figuring. The administrator is so cute because every once in a while she asks for a recipe and then she gives me a pack of paper so I can print them. I am president of the resident council and most of the family members come to me to take care of their grievances - this way I do my part - and the staff can take care of the larger problems!

I came to Recipezaar 9 years ago looking for a duck salad recipe. Bergy answered my request, I took a look around the site and joined that day (January 18th 2002). I can't remember my life without Recipezaar. I've made (and met) many wonderful friends through it. In 2005, I was invited to host the brand new Australian/New Zealand forum, but quit that role recently and am really enjoying just being a Groupie! I am married to Russell. He was a widower with 3 teenage boys and I was a single parent with two little boys when we met in Feb 1992. We now have 5 wonderful grown men (my baby is 26), 5 beautiful partners (we finally got the girls) 2 special grandsons, and count ourselves so lucky. The night Russ and I met, we stayed up until 6am talking about food and wine and 18 years later, we are still doing it!  This mutal love of food lead to a huge weight gain for both of us (both around 110kgs) so at the end of March 2010, I  decided enough is enough and  embarked on my own weight loss program. We've reduced fat intake and protein portions, upped fibre (so lots of fresh fish, veg, salads and a bit more fruit), reduced alcohol and stopped snacking (unless it's a piece of fruit or a pickled onion or cucumber). I have lost 33 kg (or around 72 lbs) to date (August 2011)and  I've gone from an Aus size 24 (US 20) to my current 14/16 (US 10/12) I'd like to lose a futher 8 kgs, but one step at a time! Russ  has lost 38 kg so is the lightest he's been since arriving in Australia 32 years ago! I  get a shock these days when I do the laundry cos his clothes are so SMALL!!! People often say they are amazed because losing weight is so hard but I'm amazed at how easy this is. And so much nicer than the alternative I was looking at-lap banding! I can go out and eat and drink as I wish, then come home and be sensible. It's certainly working for us! I can walk, get up and down off the floor or ground, and I now buy clothes  because I like them, not just because they fit!). My blood pressure has gone from dangerous to perfect, my cholesterol and blood sugars are perfect and way back into normal now so it's been really good from a health aspect too. For every day this has taken, I feel like I've been given back two-my life has changed so much with the things I now feel I can do. I even managed to walk almost 11ks around the big red rock Uluru in the top picture and I know I couldn't have done it 12 months before. My eventual aim is to ride on the FRONT of the camel-recently, I had to ride on the back as I'm heavier than Russ lol. But twelve months ago I couldn't ride at all as I was out of the weight range to do so! Once upon a time, I used to be a chef, cooking for a living, but now just really enjoy cooking for the two of us, family and friends. I think that my food knowledge has really helped in our weight loss though. The middle photo was at my starting weight of 110kg taken in Feb 2010 and the bottom taken January 2011 and 24kg lighter, the TOP taken in April 2011 and 27kgs lighter!  I can see the difference even if you can't LOL. I wish I knew how to edit them into order. Russ and I still love our food-we wake up thinking about dinner and go to sleep remembering it. I especially like light, bright Asian food and if it has duck in it, that's an added bonus. We are keen fisher people and keep ourselves well supplied with fresh fish, squid, crabs and fresh yabbies (crawfish). In February 2006 we headed off on what was to be  3 years and two months travelling Australia. It was the most wonderful time of our lives but all things must end and in May 2009, we moved into a brand new villa unit. I  realised then how much I had missed my own laundry room, kitchen and sofa (all things I took for granted until we travelled in our caravan).  Since coming home, we've spent the winters travelling and fishing in the warm northerly parts of Australia and the summers in our gorgeous little home amongst friends and family. It's a wonderful life and I feel so very privilaged to be able to experience it! When we leave home to travel, we take along all the food in our pantry, carry a domestic freezer, vacuum sealer, all our knives and favourite cookware and eat exactly the same as we would at home (perhaps we eat more fresh seafood)-we aren't on vacation-we're just living somewhere else! Why did I give you the stars that I gave you??? 5 stars=awsome, fantastic, amazing, nothing to complain about 4 stars=very good, but I added something, felt it needed something, the recipe wasn't particularly well written or it really wasn't awesome, fantastic or amazing, just very good 3 stars=it was OK 2 stars=it was forgetable 1 star=no one could/would eat it tonight, tomorrow or ever again",Contributor,4.7,224,2002-01-01,2,181,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pie.png,727

I enjoy cooking so much and though I could turn to more convenience foods to help me out, I just don't like to. My food is a source of pride for me. Some of my best memories are of my Mom in the kitchen. So, let the laundry pile up and the dust accumulate because I am spending my time in the kitchen. I live in a close knit community and have an excellent support network of other Moms. There are a lot of good cooks in the bunch so there is a lot of recipe swapping. My MOPS group just sent a cookbook to the printer to make it back by the holidays. I helped with the editing. Blacksburg may be small but the presence of Virginia Tech ensures that we have a constant ebb and flow of folks from all over the place. Small town meets global world. I'm originally from Indiana where I was raised to love basketball but have transitioned over to Hokie football. Sometimes our town IS that football team. Certainly, I love the tailgating and I feel at home among the ever present sea of orange and maroon. I love this place. If I am eating out in Blacksburg, I'm most likely to be seen at Gillies's for breakfast, Cabo Fish Taco for lunch, and the Cellar for dinner. RecipeZaar is the cooking site I visit most. I can almost always find what I am looking for here. The reviews and ratings are so helpful. The folks here seldom let me down. I have accumulated quite a recipe collection from you all. Thank you! I find myself in the natural foods section of the grocery more and more these days. I have been gradually weaning the family off of processed foods. I can't fathom becoming a vegetarian anytime soon so we buy organic beef from a local farmer. It's great stuff and we get it at a good price. I've been cooking with whole grains and fresh produce more often lately. I am trying my hand at making my own mayo and ketchup. I went in with a friend to purchase a grain mill to mill our own grains into flour. I look forward to gaining more experience in bread making. Want to try grain soaking. My favorite cookbooks are my old Fanny Farmer and Good Housekeeping, a 1990 edition of the NY Times cookbook, and an Amish cookbook by Marcia Adams. I still love my sweets. I tell myself that if I make it from scratch and I use more organic and raw ingredients, that it's OK. Not exactly healthy but an improvement. I do find that many of the desserts I used to like are just too sweet for me anymore. This has put me on a quest to update or replace some of the recipes I've had for a long time. Other interests of mine include children's literature, cardmaking, writing, afternoon naps. the art of Charles Harper & Audrey Kawasaki, craftsman houses, and tournament-style Scrabble. Autumn is my favorite season. Few things please me more than the fall's crisp air, leaves dancing around in a cascade of colors, and my glorious friends the pumpkins. The Blue Ridge Mountains are perfect. Plenty of trails locally and in the mountains to do lots of nature walks.",Contributor,4.7,"Blacksburg, VA",2004-06-01,10,23,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/fruit-kebab.png,1582

84757,95743,https://www.food.com/user/95743,sugarpea,"I’m a former interior designer and landscape designer. At the moment I get to enjoy being at home and working only when I want to. I like rollerblading, hiking, backpacking and trips to the ocean. I grew up on a farm in the Midwest and moved to the Northwest when I was thirty, over twenty years ago. I’m afraid they’ll have to bury me here in WA. This is God’s country and I’m never leaving. I have a smallish collection of cookbooks, preferring to use the library and a copy machine. Among my favorites though, are: Recipes 1-2-3, by Rozanne Gold, a collection of recipes containing no more than 3 ingredients (excepting water, salt and pepper); A Treasury of Great Recipes, by Mary and Vincent Price, recipes collected from friends and chefs of great restaurants around the world; The Mediterranean Diet Cookbook, by Nancy Harmon Jenkins, about a collection of cuisines I’m convinced are the healthiest in the world and The Low-Calorie Gourmet, by Pierre Franey. Currently my passions are our dogs, the garden, cooking, the natural world and of course, Dh. I can now add Zaar to that list of passions (translate: addiction). We have three dogs, two rescued and one adopted. They are Sugarpea, a Golden Retriever, Chickpea, a Llasa Apso and Sweetpea, a Shih Tzu; small, medium and large. We’re quite a sight out on the trail.

84759,327600,https://www.food.com/user/327600,Swan Valley Tammi,"I live in beautiful western Manitoba, Canada. I'm a wife and stay-at-home mom with 2 daughters, Peanut (who turned 7 at the end of January) and Fidget (who will turn 5 in the middle of June) and a husband whom I call The Bushman, who's motto, lucky for me, is I'll try anything once! I'm a Mennonite by heritage as well as faith. I'm a born again Christian and we belong to a small Evangelical Mennonite country church where The Bushman and I are fairly involved. The church is made up largely of family groups -- most are related somehow. That's actually a Mennonite pastime, finding out how everyone's related to each other. If we're not directly related, we'll find a connection somehow -- your third cousin's wife's brother is for SURE my mother's father's sister-in-law's nephew!! See, isn't it amazing how small this world really is?! For fun, I enjoy photography -- my favourite subjects are sunsets, cloud formations, my girls, and nature close-ups -- reading, (John Grisham, Frederick Forsythe, Robert Ludlum, and Clive Cussler are my favourite authors), playing piano, and going for nice long walks, either first thing in the morning or towards sunset. I've even learned to enjoy it in the dead of winter, when I have no choice but to walk in semi-darkness. For those of you who've never experienced a Manitoba winter (lucky you!), 'the dead of winter' includes pretty much all of December, January, and February!! And up here, our shortest days of the year have only 7 hours of daylight, so if it's cloudy, well, it feels like no daylight at all! It's my favourite time to plan my day, pray, and daydream about what might happen if I'd ever actually buy a lottery ticket and win!! I love cooking -- baking not so much (mostly because it's not essential to survival and if there's baking in the house, that's all we eat!!) -- and reading recipe books is a favourite pastime of mine. I love the Company's Coming series of cookbooks, but my favourite is Taste of Home magazine. Since buying a premium membership here though, I've decided to let my subscription run out. I'll miss it, but I've decided there's really no need for it, since all the best recipes in the world eventually end up here!!",Contributor,4.6,,2006-06-01,5,25,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/burger.png,2296

84763,357272,https://www.food.com/user/357272,the_cookie_lady,"***09-02-2007 UPDATE*** I will soon be moving again. Finally, I will be out on my own. Just imagine what culinary adventures I will embark on then! I also have been admitted into the baking program at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa, California and am also attending my first semester at California State University, Fullerton. I have two years left before I can get my BA in English and one more year following that before I have my teaching credentials. Then I will be off to teach high school English while I wait to gather the needed money and experience to open my own dream bakery! ***02-08-2007 UPDATE*** I went out looking for a job and, on the first application I turned in, the lady interviewed me right on the spot and gave me the job. I am now an ICING MAKER!!!! I make the icing for the cookie bouquets that can be found on www.cookiesbydesign.com . She has also since taught me to bake the cookies, as well as how to process the sales and assembly of the cookie bouquets. All I have left to learn is how to decorate them (although I have already done some lettering on the message cookies). ***02-02-2007 UPDATE*** I now live with one of my good friends from back in high school. Her family offered to help me out by letting me live with them while I attend college down in Southern California. I just transfered down here with intent to start at the California State University of Fullerton in the fall. Getting a computer to work around here is a toughie, so I won't be able to post or message as often as I was when I lived with my grandparents. I'll do my best, though! I LOVE to bake! I would really like to have a bakery someday. I don't get to try out as many recipes as I used to now that I live with a friend from high school and her family. Food Network is about the only TV I watch anymore and I have a growing cookbook collection. Cooking is my comfort and, surprisingly enough, I've found that I eat FAR less when I make it myself. Thats TWO great benefits! I seem to have a little obsession, though, with collecting cookbooks. I guess it is getting pretty bad when I have to sneak new cookbooks into the house and hide them in the towel closet in my bathroom so my grandma doesn't see them and tell me I'm crazy for bringing another cookbook home. I buy all my cookbooks at thrift stores, garage sales, library sales, etc. I especially love old cookbooks and cookbooks from church, school, or charity groups. A lot of the recipes I submit are recipes from my many cookbooks that I haven't tried yet. Since most of my cookbooks are in storage right now, I need to get rid of as many of these cookbooks as I can. I plan to save the recipes I want before donating the cookbooks back to the library. My obligatory chunkett (that's probably not a word, but I use it ALL the time) about my other half because I love him so much: My boyfriend now lives about 20 minutes away from me since I moved back down to Southern California. Before my move, we were about 5-6 hours apart (I still can't believe we went through that for over a year!). We have been friends for years but lost touch during the 4 years that he went to college. He graduated June 2005 and we got back in touch that July. We have been dating since December 2, 2005 and are a pretty idyllic match thus far. He is one of my best friends. He gave me a promise ring 4-8-06 and we do plan to get married. The only thing holding us back is my dad's single wish that I graduate college before I get married. This is the only guy he has ever liked that I have dated, so I figure a few more years isn't that long to wait. Life would be so very different if something happened and he were to be taken away from me..... Anyway, onward ho! Gosh, I love food!",Contributor,4.4,,2006-09-01,11,7,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/burger.png,5032

I love to cook and experiment with new recipes. I've been collecting cookbooks (I have a few hundred) and recipes for as long as I can remember. I like to buy recipe boxes at yard sales and auctions and peak through them for yummy recipe gems. I've found some really amazing recipes that way. I'm a huge fan of Le Creuset enameled cast iron cookware. I've been collecting different pieces for a few years now. I always considered myself a great cook but these pans raise things to a whole new level. I'm planning to post all of my favorite recipes that I've collected over the years. I have all these clippings and pieces of paper and magazine clips that are everywhere. My recipe boxes are packed with these things and it's time to organize the whole mess. I suppose it will take years (did I say years?!?) to get them all posted but it's worth it. So keep checking back to my posts for new goodies. I can't wait to see what long lost gems turn up. I've already run across several of my old favs. Isn't it nice to have all your best recipes all organized right here? I've also been printing them out and putting them in a nice new binder where I can actually find them when I want to make them. I LOVE this site. I have found some of the best recipes EVER right here on 'Zaar. There are some fantastic cooks here and I just want to say ""Thank you"" to all of you who have made me look like the greatest cook on the planet with your wonderful recipes. I try to make as many new ones each week as I can. It's so much fun experimenting. My DH of 9 years is my guinea pig- he will eat ANYTHING I put in front of him. My little girl... well, she's more of a challenge to please. Not really picky but she doesn't really like meat or stuffing or peppers or mushrooms or.... oh, the new one is onions. I could go on but you get the idea. You probably have or had one just like her. They seem to learn all about these things that they don't like at school.

My three children are now in college and before they come home they request their favorite meal. I still continue to cook in the crock pot for my husband and I. It is nice after a long day to know your meal is ready. It also helps in keeping my grocery bill down. With zaar, I can print my shopping list and that is all I purchase is the ingredients on that list. Now, my two daughters have been crock pot cooking while in college.

I have enjoyed cooking and baking since I was first able to peer over the top of Mom’s kitchen counter. I have been married for over 25 years and have one adult daughter. My hobbies (other than cooking) include gardening, yoga, shopping, reading, and crafts. I also have a commitment to myself to work out for an hour at least 3 times a week Every other weekend, DH and I go to our weekend home at a golf course country club. On Friday afternoons, we usually eat lunch on the road as we try to beat the traffic out of town. I'm always looking for new sandwich ideas for those Friday lunches. Once we get there, I don't want to drive yet again to the supermarket or even out to dinner. (The closest supermarket is 3 miles away.) Through 'zaar, I have found the convenience of ""dump"" recipes for Friday night dinners. I make them up in advance and freeze, then just put them in the ice chest for the trip. They are ready to grill or bake for dinner. During the week, I stick with quick and easy recipes that can be prepared in 45 minutes or less. On weekends is when I try the more complicated recipes that take a longer time to prepare. I've assembled by main dish cookbooks accordingly. I have nothing against convenience foods (use them all the time!) and I am in no way a food snob. However, I don't cook with cream of xxxx soups, processed cheese food, and others of that ilk. Besides being full of sodium, fat and other bad things, I just don't care for the taste and texture. DH is lactose-intolerant and has high cholesterol, which challenges me to find healthy good-tasting recipes.",Contributor,4.4,United States,2004-02-01,0,20,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pie.png,133

I feel very privileged to be one of the hosts on the Photo Forum. Taking photos of my culinary efforts is a full time hobby and I love it. My friends all know what to expect when they come to dinner ""Are you finished taking pictures?"" or ""Did you get a photo of so & so?"" I never let them wait too long and the food is NEVER cold! I now have over 6000 photos on Zaar - some fairly good and some definitely not so good. I am happy to say that practice does help. My roots are in Vancouver BC Canada - a very beautiful city that holds many wonderful memories for me. In 1990, I decided that for my retirement years I may want to settle in a smaller community and found a slice of heaven in the North Okanagan B.C. I love living here but every once in a while I miss the bright city lights, the Broadway shows and some of the small wonderful ethnic restaurants that Vancouver abounds in. That is easily resolved. I just take a trip to the coast, visit with friends for a weekend see a show and feast on Dim Sum or other specialty foods. I am getting a bit long in the tooth but was a very adventurous person. I have river rafted Hell's Gate on the Fraser river, been up in a glider over Hawaii (no not a Hang Glider!), gone hot air ballooning in the Napa Valley & the Fraser Valley, driven dune buggies on the dunes in Oregon, Para sailing in Mexico and tried many other adventurous, challenging, fun things. I have yet to try bungee jumping or sky diving. I may do them yet. I love to travel and experience other cultures. Mexco has been a favorite haunt. I have visited that lovely country many many times. Australia is another favorite as is England! In the past 16 months I have taken off 61 pounds and feel wonderful. I am off all medications and all systems are GO! In years I may be 79 but in spirit I am still in my forties. We are only as old as we allow ourselves to feel. Always think positive. Do something a bit challenging every day & always do something silly every day. Be a kid again! Laugh every day - it is internal jogging.

I have so many bread and roll recipes saved to try here on Zaar that I am set for a lifetime! Just a few of our favorite Zaar recipes.... You may notice that I leave quite a few 4 & 5 star reviews.

If something just didn't work out for me I will leave a review with no stars and admit it was probably an error made on my end.

I have a very large collection of cookbooks with Betty Crocker still being my favorite of all even if it is falling apart. lol http://i169.photobucket.com/albums/u208/diner_photos/ZWT5banner.jpg,Contributor,4.5,"Olmsted Falls, 0",2002-01-01,0,5,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/drink.png,1817

DH and I live about 40 miles north of Baltimore, in what WAS rural 40 years ago. We are empty-nesters. Have 2 adult daughters, 2 great SIL, and 3 grandchildren --1 is 22, and 16 year old twins. In September of 2011, we were presented with our first GREAT-grandson !  They all live in PA. and are VERY busy people ! I retired from MANY facets of nursing 12 years ago, and LOVE being in charge of myself ! We had a 4-couple Gourmet Group for so many years, that we ran out of new things and themes. Now we meet at restaurants, to avoid trashing the kitchen as well as the budget. We started with 7 course meals! None of us can DO that anymore !! We have been VERY fortunate to be able to travel more than we ever dreamed !! Have B&B'd in Great Britain many times; visited Italy, Greece, France, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Switzerland, and Iceland (in February !) We would far rather stay in B&B, or self-catering apartment or dwelling, than be on a tour. Our trip in '09, was to 2 small towns in Sicily --Sant'Alfio, on the slope of Mount Etna, in a 15th century, converted winery --and a week on the north coast near Cefalu. Very few spoke English, but everyone was helpful and we managed to communicate, and had a wonderful time ! (Photos in Gallery on website below !) We  returned there in Sept. '11, for a 2 week vinyard tour with a small group, led by our local wine store owner - whose family is still in Sicily ! DH is my photographer - (and a website designer) but he insists on set-up time as well as a hot meal ! I should plan ahead for serving appeal, so he can get the best shot. I am now a SIX year survivor of colon cancer, as of 5/11, and four year of thyroid. Angels on my shoulder found both lesions before I even had symptoms ! I strongly encourage screening colonoscopies starting at age 50 -- that is ONE which can be totally avoided !

Here is a quick link to the beauty recipes I've posted (highest rated so far):http://www.recipezaar.com/r/chef=6357/253/451/18/ls=h A few things I've done:- 1. Worked part time as a Telemarketer in Oman in the Crowne Plaza Hotel. 2. Worked as a Certified Professional Tarotist (Tarot Card Reader) and done accurate predicitions for many people from different parts of the world, most memorable of which is the reading I did for my college Law lecturer and it came true. 3. Written nearly 1000 poems several of which have been published in leading newspapers, ezines and magazines both in Oman and India. 4. Worked as a Moderator on www.allpoetry.com - my BEST and FAVOURITE site on the internet. My other interests include: Numerology, Vaastu Shastra, Feng Shui, Face Reading, Reiki and Astrology! I am really very keen on getting well-versed with metaphysical sciences such as Astrology, I-Ching, Feng Shui, Runes, Enneagram, Kabbalah and many more. I love researching on the mythology of ancient Goddesses and then condensing my research into poems. In the mood to gift me something?

I like a variety of foods and I have cook books from my family and from several of the ladies I did home health care for over the years,  The recipes are old and sometimes instructions are not what i would like . I tended to use their recipes as it was often easier getting people to eat food they were accustomed to. The handwritten cards were sometimes hard to read but I've done my best to be true to the recipes.

84961,353579,https://www.food.com/user/353579,pattikay in L.A.,"Welcome to my page! It's a good place to start looking if you need to find me since I come here nearly every day for inspiration as I pursue the noble occupation of feeding family and friends. My family moved across the country to southern California 7 years ago. The first time I ever set foot on California soil (or anywhere in the West, for that matter) was the day I moved here. I experienced a form of culture/environment shock for about a year - even the air is different out here! For the first year, I would look at the roads and driveways that wind steeply up and down the foothills and think, Man, how does anyone drive on those in the winter? Then I would remember - they do it the same way they do in the summer - with their windows down, wearing shorts and flip-flops. I love the fact that we are near a large city, near the ocean, near the desert, near the mountains - what more could I ask for? And yes, even though I swore it wouldn't happen to me after living for more than 40 years in places with many weather extremes - I now get chilly when the temperature dips below 70 and can barely bring myself to go outdoors if it's raining. However, I do NOT wear a parka and mittens when it's 65 degrees - a sweatshirt or light jacket will do. My husband and I met while attending seminary (I dropped out before finishing one semester but he got a Master of Divinity) and we got married after knowing each other for 6 months. We are quick to tell other people that we do not advise this course of action, but we celebrated our 27th anniversary this year, so I guess sometimes rash decisions work out quite nicely. So with my husband's MDiv and my undergraduate degree in religious studies, we now both work in pharmaceutical marketing research. Just what you would expect, right? I telecommute to the east coast for work each day; I'm primarily a writer/analyst. When I was in college, writing so many research papers and unable to decide what I wanted to do when I grew up, I used to jokingly say that I should find a job writing research papers. More than 20 years later, that?s basically what I do. Cool, huh? Our wonderful son was born when we were married just one year and a mere 15 years later our bright-eyed redhead came into our lives (okay, so she was totally bald till she was nearly 2, but she's definitely red now). My kids are my best and constant reminder that perfect timing is something determined by God and not by me, since I wouldn't have dreamed up such a family-planning scheme, and yet it works just right for us. Here are some pics of the family, most of them taken while we were camping and hiking in the wilds of this beautiful state! Cooking is a great joy to me ? I constantly marvel that God gave us so many things to eat and so many ways to prepare them! We could have been like cattle or something, eating pretty much the same thing, in the same way, every day for all of our lives. What a privilege to be in charge of feeding our families (and ourselves, of course), and also being able to express our creativity and knowledge of nutritional needs at the same time. (Dessert is a nutritional need, right?) I stumbled on this site when I was searching for recipes that might use up some ingredients I had in the house ? I don?t think I?ve left since then, and I?m happy to have met and shared recipes with so many nice folks around the world.

Recipezaar has made it so incredibly easy to meet these goals!!! I am totally obsessed with cooking, and I couldn't stop if I wanted to. It is as natural to me as breathing. I can remember looking through my mother's cookbooks as soon as I could read. While I mostly prefer modern recipes, I do have some old time favorites. I use the same Betty Crocker cookbook my mother uses. It is the 2nd Edition Betty Crocker cookbook reprinted in 1956. I found it at a used book store. I also use a Pillbury cookbook, a Fanny Farmer cookbook, The New Basics Cookbook and Great Good Food (both by Julee Ross). I also find good recipes in Cooking Light and Southern Living magazines. While I have discovered and love Paula Deen, my cooking is taking a new direction. I am trying to eat more monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), less saturated fats, more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fiber, and more omega 3s, i.e., basically the Mediterranean diet. I am doing it not only to maintain a healthy weight, but also for my long term health. I am not saying goodbye to all the luscious things I used to eat, I am just changing how much of those I eat. I am probably somewhat demanding in my reviews. If the recipe is not a WOW meal, I probably won't give it a 5 star rating. With so many recipes on 'Zaar, there is no reason to settle for less than 5 stars every night of the week! I have recenlty become interested in foodie fiction, since I am a foodie! Someday I will write a book that involves cooking. I am not sure if I should write a fiction book or non fiction, but I know that I love to read anything that involves cooking.",Contributor,4.6,212,2006-02-01,7,3,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/fruit-kebab.png,982

My rating system: 5 stars if the recipe works without having to make changes (my own subs just for personal preference do not count) *New Rule: If hubby says ""mmmm"" or ""this is good"" without me asking if he likes it, it automatically gets five stars 4 stars if the recipe needs a minimal amount of changing because the recipe does not work the way it was written or if overall it just didn't WOW me. 3 stars and below if the recipe just does not work or if the instructions are not written clearly enough to make it. Please know that I will change your recipe to fit my diet. I mean no disrespect, but since I have to diet I have to do it. I refuse to limit myself to recipes that already fit my diet and like the challenge of changing already existing recipes to be healthier. I will leave out the oil, leave out or replace the cheese and milk with a non-dairy alternative, and use whole grains. I will also leave out meat and broth and choose vegetarian, low sodium versions/alternatives. I still rate recipes that I make these changes to. But, if I use a recipe as inspiration only- meaning I got a great idea from it but changed it all around- I generally will not give any stars but will put a little note stating what I did. I love to give credit where credit is due. I don't deduct stars if I personally do not like an ingredient in the recipe. I don't make recipes that I think that I won't like, which is why you will probably notice that most of my ratings are pretty high. I think it is silly that people choose to make recipes that include ingredients that they don't like then rate them poorly saying ""I don't care for..."" Anyway, you get the idea.

While I grew up watching my Italian grandmother in the kitchen, I remained uninterested in trying anything on my own. As a young lady, I was known for being particularly ignorant in the kitchen, with no idea how to even make a hot dog! All this changed, however, when I got engaged. I realized it was time to let my inherent talents out of the bag. At the time, the New York Times had a weekly column called The 60-Minute Gourmet by Pierre Franey. Each week, I would follow these recipes diligently, and taught myself to cook that way. From there, I began to read cookbooks and consult with relatives on family recipes. At my ripe old age now, I feel I know enough to put together a very pleasing meal and have become accomplished in my own right. Having an Irish father and an Italian mother, I'm glad I inherited the cooking gene (and the drinking one too!). One thing I have learned is that simpler is always better! I always believe cooking fills a need to nurture and show love. After being widowed fairly young and living alone with my dog and cats, I stopped cooking for awhile, since I really had no one to cook for.

I found Zaar after I got married and it's been such a lifesaver and so much fun. I enjoy the games and DH and DS enjoy the food!I usually work as a surgical tech but since my son was born I moved into my new profession as a stay at home mom. It's a nice change I've been enjoying it and it gives me more time to COOK! I like to share recipes that I enjoy or have eaten at some of my fav places. I'm a San Diegan currently living in New York with my Husband and our 15month old Son. When I first came to zaar I recipe selected mostly 4 and 5 rated recipes but now after playing several games and seeing the different ways people review. I realize so many recipes miss a good chance. So now I just go by ingredients or a good idea and choose my recipes based on that. I've been lucky enough to grow up eating a variety of cuisines from various cultures and have eaten at some really great restaurants from hole in the wall to 5star. So I let my palate do the choosing and so far I've had pretty good luck picking recipes. I don't generally rate recipes by cooking time or exact measurement of ingredients unless it's a baking recipe or the temp and time were just way off. I also won't give a bad rating because of my lack of ingredients or skill. I don't measure when I cook unless it's baking. I give the recipe a good read and eyeball the amounts. This works for me. I know everyone has different tastes and I will be hard pressed to give a rating of 3 unless it just really didn't work for me. I don't see any reason to hurt anyone's feelings when I can just give a detailed review of my changes or no rating instead.

All of our cats were born in the wild and adopted by us. Zaar Chefs I have met so far: Elmotoo, justcallmeToni, ~Rita~, Midwest Maven, Bird&Buddha (both of them) and most recently, Ms*Bindy from upstate New York:) Wonderful, sweet, friendly people and great chefs! Most relevant thing to mention here is that I am a vegetarian, and recently became a vegan (almost 100%). To put vegetables and other things not meat or fish on the table I work as an actuary (in my case anyway, a combination of statistician, number-cruncher and/or programmer). For fun I like to travel. Just came back from Namibia, a peaceful democracy in Africa with lots of animals! Got some terrific pictures of lions, leopards, cheetahs, elephants, rhinocerous, hyenas, all kinds of antelopes, giraffes and zebras. Namibia is the second most sparsely populated country per square mile, just behind Mongolia. Update:  We went to Italy this Spring.  We had lots of pizza and pasta.  The pizza is so much better in Italy, particularly the crust.  The Amalfi coast was absolutely beautiful.  Spectacular natural scenery (Canada and Alaska are really beautiful, Patagonia in Chile is sublime, Iceland is unique) has been my latest passion as far as travel destinations but I have seen quite a few big cities too (Paris, Berlin, London and Madrid to name a few). On my bulletin board at work I keep a list of every country I've visited (other than the U.S. of course). So far I've made it to five continents: Europe, Africa, South America, Asia and North America of course. I've got only two other continents to conquer:) I don't usually have difficulty finding vegetarian dishes here in the U.S. or overseas, but finding vegan dishes is much harder. I have no kids, just cats, Kumquat, Cranberry, and more recently Quincy and Kiwi. They are purebreds, of the breed alley caticus (okay, American shorthair I guess). Our cats are not vegetarians, though my boyfriend (significant other, long-term partner, whatever) is. I am a friend of all animals both tamed and wild. In addition I am a freethinker and my boyfriend studies philosophy. Either way, we get along pretty well.  Also, please allow me to say that my BF and I recently bought a condominium in NYC.:)  Pet peeve?

I've worked for the US Postal Service for the past 15 years and love my job! I've been married for 27 years to my best friend and have beautiful twin daughters (pictured below). One is an art major and musician (she plays viola, guitar, piano, drums, and has the voice of an angel). The other is a French major, Starbucks barista, and ballet dancer, formerly with Ballet Magnificat and now an apprentice with the contemporary ballet company, Arova. My biggest pet peeve? People who bash the Post Office. Given the resources it has the Post Office does a remarkable job. For less than 50¢ someone will come to your house, pick up a letter and deliver it to the other side of the country in a few days time. What a bargain! The majority of postal workers I know are dedicated hard-working employees who take pride in their jobs. Just like in any company/organization you will find some slackers but the reason so much is heard about bad service or bad employees in USPS is because the Post Office is one of the only agencies that touches every American's life. Anytime you have a service problem, instead of just complaining to your friends & family, ask to speak to the postmaster/station manager. If you don't get the result you want write a letter to your congressman. All congressional inquiries are promptly addressed. The fact is that most people find it easier to complain and do nothing rather than do what needs to be done to address the issue.

I guess that is where my love for cooking began. I also enjoy sharing the kitchen with my DH (Sgt. Pepper). He doesn't cook as often as he did when we first got married, but he makes an awesome pizza and still makes them at least twice a month. He keeps his recipes for the dough and the sauce top secret, even from me. LOL I have two step-children. The oldest graduated from college and the youngest is a sophomore at Texas Tech.

I grew up in the US, but I have spent most of the last few years in Europe now live in Germany, with my German husband. Much of the time that I have lived in Europe, I have lived in international student housing so I have lived with and cooked with people from all over world. I have also have had to learn to improvise a bit because it isn't always easy to get the foods I miss from the US here. My husband is a good cook and likes to cook when he has time, but he quite often makes what he knows, mainly German food. So I am the one feeding him strange things. :D My husband has recently taken up hunting so I am having to learn how to cook game: wild boar, deer, hares and geese are the most common things hunted here. It isn't easy to find things for wild boar so I am trying to publish ones that I find that we really liked. I like Recipezaar because I can easily find recipes for whatever I am in the mood, or whatever I happen to have laying around when I am too lazy to walk to the supermarket. :) I like trading tips with the people at the Asian and the German/Benelux forums, I lurk there mostly, but post when I have questions or think that I can help. My reviews are mainly 4 or 5 stars because I won't try anything that I don't think that I will like. 5 stars is it was great, will make again, only very minor changes were made, if any. 4 stars is it was very good, will probably make again, made some changes to adjust to my taste. 3 stars is it was okay, probably won't make again but I didn't really mind eating it. I haven't had anything here that I thought was lower than that, which is good with how picky I am. I'll try most new things if it sounds good, but I am not afraid to say if I don't like it. I quite often make my own recipes out of some of the ones I find here, and don't post recipe reviews if I radically changed it.",Contributor,4.6,,2007-03-01,11,4,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pie.png,3615

I changed this, I changed that, and your recipe was just awful!

If you really look, you can see the sign waaaayyy back there behind us! Don't I look like a star in my shades?? ;) I live in a town of about 1500 and work at an insurance office here in town. I am married with a 13 year old daughter, a 32 year old stepson and, as of Dec 11, 04, a daughter in law. They now have a one year old daughter, Natalie. She's a sweetie! I love NASCAR!! Root for Tony Stewart. Ya I know, alot of people don't like him, but love the bad boy attitude!! We go to a couple of races a year; love it!! I confess...I'm a redneck!!! I like to read, cross-stitch and I love to cook when the weather turns cool. I love music, mainly country and classic rock. I love to sing, too, but nobody else would enjoy it, so I keep that to myself!! I love to go out with girlfriends, have a few drinks and dance the night away. I like to ride my bike and walk when the weather is warm. I love the outdoors and would rather work in the yard anytime than in the house. My daughter plays on a traveling softball team in the summer, so that keeps us busy about every weekend. Actually, they practice most of the year, so we're never too far from a softball field!! She also plays softball at school, so we go from one team to the next! I love it and will miss it when she's too old to play! She pitches and plays 1st base. Her new coach is going to try her at third this year, so that will be something new for her. I LOVE any kind of animal, especially dogs, and am very concerned about animal welfare, especially Greyhound rescue. The retired racers go through so much and are so appreciative when they finally get to go home with someone! If I had the time & the cash, I would run away to a tropical island. There's nothing better than swaying palm trees, balmy breezes and turquoise water. I love to wake up in the morning and hear the waves crashing. A cold margarita isn't a bad addition, either! I LOVE dogs; I have really grown to love Greyhounds; what personality!! We adopted Missileman on May 15, 2006; a great birthday gift for me!! He is a retired racer, but now seems happy just to be a dog! We also have a 5 year old yellow cat, Drew. A real troublemaker! We also have a 5 year old Black Lab named Angus. He is actually my stepson's dog, but it seems we're his permanent family! We also have an adopted fur baby, Tanner. He actually belongs to the neighbor, but he loves us and visits everytime he escapes!! There are three things I want to do before I die (well, more than 3, I'm sure, but...) I want to visit Hawaii and Australia and I want to swim with dolphins. My pet peeves are two faced, backstabbing people. And, people who only want to be a friend when you can do something for them.

Before finding 'Zaar, I was less of a cook and more of a recipe collector but now I try many more things and we're having more fun in the kitchen (at least I am)! Thanks for all your ratings, comments and help in the forums AND for posting so many great recipes. You've enhanced my cooking skills and expanded my horizons! I've learned so much. For fun, I also like to read fiction, travel, see movies and shows, shop (and I love to browse thrift shops and rummage/garage sales for cookbooks, etc.).

I have enjoyed cooking for as long as I can remember. Thanks to everyone that has tried and reviewed my recipes :>) My review guidelines are as follows: 5 stars - Wonderful ! Perfect as posted and plan to make this recipe again! 4 stars - Liked it a lot and will make again but will probably alter the recipe slightly. 3 stars - OK but to make it again would require major changes to the original recipe to suit my tastes. 2 stars - Really didn't like it.

85409,25792,https://www.food.com/user/25792,LAURIE,"Before I get to the details let me tell you how I rate recipes.....and tell you how I feel about others ratings! 5 STARS....This recipe was excellant, we liked it very much, the directions were very clear and if I made any minor substitutions I noted it. It would most likely be made again, many times! 4 STARS....This recipe was good, we liked it but I made changes either in taste or it was not clear in something, but I would consider making it again. 3 STARS....This recipe was not something that got approval from the majority. Either it just didnt work in preparation, directions, or taste. I will tell you why and would not make it again unless I altered it much! 2, 1 STARS.....I DO NOT give these as I feel they are NOT worthy....especially if the recipe previously had good reviews and by my giving a low one would jeopardize the ratings. I would appreciate this reciprocated with reviews to my recipes. 0 STARS....COMMENTS I will leave no stars and comments on something that did not work out for me and I will be honest and tell you why. I DETEST IT WHEN PEOPLE CHANGE YOUR RECIPE OR DONT EVEN MAKE IT THEN LEAVE YOU LOW REVIEWS. PEOPLE WHO DO THAT ARE JUST BEING VINDICTIVE OR JUST PLAIN STUPIDLY CRUEL. Examples of some I've gotten would be: 1 star...This doesnt sound like something we would like 2 stars...too sweet for me, (this was on a all 5 star recipe). Now for the details: I was born, raised and still live in the same midwestern town where comfort food is what we thrive on, however my dream is to retire to the northwoods of Wisconsin.. (the sooner the better IMHO)! I relish a recipe that is simple, quick and tastes great as I am a divorced mom to 4 very busy, active young adults (27, 25, 20 year old daughters and a 21 year old son.) Cooking time is at a premium as everyone is so busy, I never usually know who will be at my house for supper! I also try to find things that will reheat well. I have worked for 30 years in the accounting field and presently semi retired. It is very nice for a change to not have to deal with the everyday stress of deadlines and office politics! It has been great cooking for pleasure, at my leisure, instead of to feed the troops! Cooking relaxes me so I do it often and I love to cook for people who appreciate it. It is nothing for me to start a recipe at 10pm right before bedtime, and yes I have cooked all nite. Kind of a marathon!! Cookbooks are my passion and I can't resist the ones that churches, schools etc. put together and well as the ones in the grocery stores. My collection numbers well over 2000 and where as some people go to bed with a good novel, my nightstand is full of cookbooks! I love to bake and its nothing for me to make 15-20 different kinds of cookies and candies for the holidays. I guess that it has rubbed off on my oldest daughter who is a culinary school graduate and knee deep in pastry classes, hoping to become a pastry chef! In March of 2002 I had gastric bypass, weight loss surgery and I have lost 125 pounds FOREVER, so now when I do cook it IS for everyone else to enjoy. I love Zaar and all the friends I have made here, this sight is so addictive but yet so much fun! And the recipes aren't bad either..LOL! I know that in the years since Ive been a permanent fixture of this site I have acquired many great recipes and tons of cooks that I am proud to call my friends!

Besides helping customers choose wine they will like (and also help with food and wine pairings for their menus), I also get to help with the catering end of the business, so I get to spend a fair amount of time in the kitchen making fun appetizers and beautiful food displays. I also work part-time at the fromagerie next door. So yeah - that means I eat on the job, too. :^D We live on several peaceful wooded acres on a cute little river in rural NE Wisconsin, with a cranky old-lady Burmese and whatever stray outdoor cats that have decided to adopt us on any given day. The cute puppy in the picture is Jake, our Elhew-bred English Pointer that we brought home on Easter weekend 2007. I've also got 2 painted turtles named Dennis and Fuzz, and a bunch of fish (koi and goldfish, along with the guppies & swordtails in the turtle tank). I USUALLY eat and cook healthy, but I rarely pass up dessert, either. I do not eat red meat, and try to limit other animal products, too. I love to bake, although I seem to collect a lot of scone and biscotti recipes which I NEVER get around to making. I bake and eat A LOT of cookies and muffins... I almost always reduce the sugar by 1/4 and use whole wheat pastry flour for at least part of the flour. Those two changes do so much to make recipes healthier without compromising taste. I try to reduce fat whenever I can, too, but while I want to eat healthy, I still want to ENJOY what I eat!!! I seem to give a lot of 4 and 5 star reviews here - I seem to have a pretty good sense of what I like by looking at a recipe before I try it. Thank you to anyone that tries my recipes in return, or photographs them.

I love to cook, and like having my little helpers in the kitchen! I usually love recipes that are completely from scratch (I still love them actually) but right now my focus is on having any kind of food ready by mealtime! It's a little crazy here lately. Every summer we have a huge organic garden, apple orchard and raspberry and blueberry patches, along with a woods full of wild foods waiting for me to learn what they are so I can collect them. I'm learning about wild mushrooms first, so if anyone has any tips, let me know. We also eat wild venison which my husband and I hunt ourselves. It's our favorite meat, since it's lean, organic and cheap! Some of my hobbies are: hiking, biking, rock climbing, gardening, playing in the water with my kids, or just swinging in the hammock with a good book. I go stir crazy if I spend too much time inside.",Contributor,4.6,,2005-01-01,4,40,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pasta.png,2020

For those of you that don't know, Tucson is a culinary Mecca; tons of amazing flavors, foods, and restaurants to investigate. The above photo is a picture of my husband and I on our wedding day. He's the light of my life, and the main reason I'm glad I moved out here to the desert because I never would have met him if I hadn't!! To top it off, he's a great eater. It doesn't matter what I make, even if he doesn't like it he tells me between bites. (haha!) He loves my obsession with the Zaar because he's been eating really well since I started with the site. We recently bought our first house which is a starter home that we are working very hard on remodeling. Anyone with free advice for newbie homeowners lemme know because it has been a whirlwind!! I am currently a full time employee at the UofA (GO WILDCATS!) and I love my job and the people that I work with. I am also a part time student seeking a Masters degree in Administration. I can't wait to be finished so that I can relax for a little while, cook, work on my house, and play with my two beautiful children who are pictured below (yes I'm aware that they are dogs, but they are OUR kids!!) The one on the left is our little blue heeler mix that we call Rumplestiltzkin (Bumpy for short) and the one on the left is the sweetest Chow Retriever Mix you'll ever meet. His name is Gaizen. The picture of the two dippy looking people on Segways is one of my husband and I in Disney World this last October. We were soooo lucky to beable to go on the segway tour it was loads of fun! The cutie patutie right beside us is my little niece Rylee who I don't get to see nearly enough since my sister live in Ohio. She's couldn't be sweeter if you spread icing on her. The picture of the cake is one that I made for my DH's 27th birthday because he loves fish tanks. Anyone that wants the ingredients and how to build it lemme know it's really easy!! My Rating System: 5 stars-RUN don't walk to your grocery store, buy the ingredients and make this! 4 stars-Great recipe and I want to try it again but would probably make changes to it 3 stars-Pretty good recipe that I liked but probably will only make occasionally I don't like to give less than three stars because everyone is different and has different taste buds. I also will not give a recipe less than four stars if I myself made changes to the recipe and then didn't like the way it turned out. If I screw a recipe up entirely (I have been known to do this especially with baked goods) I don't bother even rating it. The one thing that is really hard to say here at the Zaar is ""I will definitly make this again"" not because soooo many recipes that I have tried are not worthy of making again, but because there are so many more out there that I haven't tried yet! Every time I think of repeating one of my favorites I find myself on here about to look it up, and then finding something just as interesting, unique, and delicious sounding that I just have to try!!",Contributor,4.6,,2007-02-01,10,27,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pasta.png,4386

I started baking at a very early age and my mother was always supportive (even tho she probably did not have time). By the time I was 12 I was competing in local fairs and won quite a few ribbons. Later in my teens I added cooking (French style) to my hobbies and still prefer this style of cooking. Now we spend 6 months of the year in Southern Portugal and have learned a lot about the Portuguese cuisine. Do prefer the Norhern Portugal type of cooking, but they have the most wonderful bread in the world. I have one daughter who trained as a French chef and worked in that field for several years. Since then she has gone on to other things. I don't have a favorite cookbook because I have too many to choose from. Since having the internet at my fingertips I have certainly expanded my recipe collections. I do take pride in serving good meals even for just the 2 of us.

85661,400420,https://www.food.com/user/400420,MarlaM,"I'm the mother of an awsome 17 year old daughter, who keeps me very busy. She is now driving and constantly wanting to take the car somewhere. She is a pretty amazing person - she does well in school, helps around the house, is very responsible and actually keeps her room pretty clean! I feel very lucky! She is also developing a love of cooking, but right now it is mostly cookies and brownies. I think she really likes the thought that she can produce something really delicious and impress her boyfriend :-) She also developed a love of sewing after not being able to find clothes that fit the way she likes them. She alters almost everything she buys! And it really comes in handy when I need something sewn! In January, I accepted a position as a Compliance Manager overseeing 4 branches of a major investment firm. It has been very challenging, but I'm learning a lot, and while I'm very overwhelmed, I'm really enjoying it. When I started this job, my office was in Torrance, but after a month, my office was moved to Santa Monica - right on the Promenade and just 2 blocks from the beach and Santa Monica Pier. Very cool area, all types of people walking around all the time. Not sure if I'll be in that location permanently, as it is quite far from home, but I'm liking it so far. My mom subscribed to the Taste of Home and Quick Cooking magazines and always ordered the annual cookbooks. When she passed away, I inherited all of her cookbooks. I've started to post recipes from those books, because it helps me keep track of my favorites. We have a very sweet 6 year old greyhound mix, Sally, who keeps us constantly entertained. She is very lovey and playful, but is always looking for trouble :-) On 1/3/08 we brought home our newest pup, Lucy, a very sweet beagle we found at the animal shelter. Sally isn't quite sure what to make of her yet, but Lucy would really like to play with her, so hopefully they will become friends. We also have a little grey cat who we just call Kitty. He is one of those cats who keeps to himself most of the time, but on the weekend mornings he demands attention and wants to play - but just for a little while, then he retreats to his room (my DD's room) and sleeps the day away. Since I found RecipeZaar, I've developed a reputation with my friends and family as a fabulous cook! This site gives me the tools to try things I never would have thought I could make! I've always been an OK cook, but in the last year or so, I've suddently realized that I really enjoy cooking and entertaining. I don't like spending hours in the kitchen, though, so I'm always on the lookout for quick and easy recipes and I've found so many here. As most people do, I usually start with a recipe and change it to suit the taste of my family or to what I have on hand. I throw together my own dishes often, but haven't posted them, because I never measure anything and just add ingredients to taste. Both of my parents were excellent cooks - both actually cooked in restaurants and my dad owned a restaurant for a few years. All of my friends loved eating at my house when I was a kid, because there was always something good cooking. My mom always had a garden and apricot tree, and she loved canning. We never had store bought jams, dill pickles or canned tomatoes when I was growing up. These days, my pantry has all store bot stuff - I always watched my mom do her canning, but never learned. Unfortunately, my recent love of cooking has shown in the wastelines of both myself and my husband. Now I'm starting to look for lower fat and calorie recipes and trying to learn how to lower the fat in the meals that I love. Pet Peeves...Mean reviews! I've seen so many mean reviews just because someone didn't like the recipe. Just because one person doesn't like a dish, doesn't mean someone else won't think it is a 5 star recipe! Also, it seems like every recipe that says ""authentic, from my grandmother who lived in (you name the country)"", someone has to say that the recipe isn't authentic. Just because one German family makes something different than another German family doesn't make it any less authentic. Different regions tend to have variations. OK, that is my gripe and it feels good to get it off my chest :-)",Contributor,4.6,"Downey, CA",2006-12-01,2,7,"http://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/h_120,w_160,c_fill,q_92/v1//pickle_media1/media/rz_migration/40/Photo_Video_400420_medthumb_hor.jpg",1453

I am a retired school teacher and live in Hemingway, South Carolina, which is about 40 miles from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. I taught Family and Consumer Sciences(formerly,Home Economics). I now work at the Boys & Girls Club of America here in my hometown. I also am a substitute teacher. Once a teacher, always a teacher. I enjoy cooking, especially for friends and family. I even prepare meals for my co-workers and take to work. They really enjoy them. Some foods I prepare, they have never had. My biggest meal of the year is at Christmas.

85771,706608,https://www.food.com/user/706608,Nikoma,"My rating system (Which I stole from HeatherFeather, I think she put it perfectly) -- 5 Stars: Outstanding,a special find that I will make over and over again. 4 Stars: Very good, something I highly recommend others to try, I would make this again, although I might make minor changes to suit my tastes. 3 Stars: Good, but not something I will make again often. Might need some slight changes, but in general the recipe works and others might enjoy this more than I did. 2 Stars: Fair, recipe did not work out well for me and I cannot recommend it. Not what I was expecting. 1 Star: Poor, recipe did not work at all and I would caution others to consider another recipe. ----------------------------- Well, obviously I love to cook since I'm here on Zaar! Besides that (in the food dept) I've got my hands in a little of everything. I do a lot of canning these days. As well as drying and freezing. I do a lot of berry picking in the summer as well as other wild foraging. I'm just learning, but I'm coming along fast. I love plants and botony so learning about local eatables and herbs has always been an interest. Plus home gardening ofcoarse :) But I don't have much room right now. I've just started experimenting with home brewing (trying some basic and easy wines and meads) Hopfully I'll eventually become adept at that and be the family's Merry maker lol Any tips are welcomed! Ideally I spend most of my time trekking around the woods and mountains here in PA looking for adventures and hidden treasures, old ruins, and historical trails. ( I may have an overactive imagination :). I love backpacking and camping. If there wasn't anyone around to drag me home I'd probably just disppear into the wilderness never to return. I have a major interest in Mythology and History (focusing mainly on Ancient Greece, but I'm enthralled by all ancient history and interested in anything up until the second half of the 20th century) I really enjoy learning the old ways of doing things. I'm definitely not suited to this cellphone infested, computer run, digitalized existence we're living, it all just hurts my head and makes me wonder if anyone has any original thought or imagination left. Halloween (Samhain) is another of my favorite things in the world. I wait for it all year and make a full week out of it. Building props and setting up yard displays keeps my head spinning strait through Sept and Oct. I admit I still go trick or treating some years. Other years I try to organize scavenger hunts or treasure hunts etc. Wish I could get more people interested though! Usually just 3 or 4 of us. I also do all the traditional things for a proper Pagan New Year so it's a very busy week! I love summer and I live for the heat. 90 degrees is when I feel the best. I hate the cold! Despite that Autumn is my favorite time of year though! Fairs, festivals (anyone who lives in PA knows we have some of the most crazy, odd and fun festivals!), Harvest feasts, Fall foraging and gathering, corn field fights, haunted hayrides, pumpkin patches, crafts, all the fresh veggies! The leaves ,the trees, the colors, dressing up, popcorn balls, candy apples, apple picking, apple cider, Mabon and Halloween, the smell of fires, and herbs.... I could go on and on here. My dream in life is basically to live off the grid. To own a large piece of land in the middle of nowhere surrounded by forest. Enough room to grow the majority of our own food (""our"" is still up in the air) To have a little cabin, some chickens, a couple of horses, my cats and a barn big enough to accommodate a small wildlife rehab center (I'm hoping to become certified in the next couple of years. I've rambled on enough I think. I have a dreaded myspace page (link below) if anyone wants to know anything more.",Contributor,4.8,,2007-12-01,0,5,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/burger.png,1868

85777,28346,https://www.food.com/user/28346,ReeLani,"Greetings from the palm of the Mitten State! I'm a 40-somthing gal with an awesome husband, Todd, and step-son, David. And I had the great privilege to be mom to the world's best cat, Bentley, for almost 12 years. As of 3/10/09 he's now free from all the ailments that plagued his past few years and is now a soft and gentle spirit who will be with me always. He was my best friend and the first real love of my life and leaves a cat-shaped hole in life. February 4, 2010, 2 new kitties joined our family.  Nick and Nate were adopted from our local humane society and fill our home with purrs and laughter and lots of fur.  We're lucky to have these two sweet kitty boys with us. I'm a certified medical coder but currently enjoying being a stay-at-home cat mom.  In past work lives I've been a corporate travel consultant, an auto claim assistant, a loan clerk, a secretary and an usher. I like to cook and LOVE to bake. It's great to share the gift of good food with my sweet wonderful husband, family and friends and co-workers. And I try to enter a couple different baked goods in my county fair each year. When I'm not working in the kitchen I enjoy reading, walking, scrapbooking, genealogy, and visiting with family and friends. I also love animals, and was a cat care volunteer at a local shelter for many years.   R?E'S STAR RATINGS (effective for 2007 ratings and beyond) 5 -- Amazing! Incredible! Want to eat it or drink it all the time! Obviously this wowed us. Maybe it?s too decadent to make very often, but we can dream. 4 -- Great! We loved it and will probably be having this frequently. 3 -- Good . We liked it and might have it again, possibly with some changes. 2 -- Passable. We ate it but won?t eat any leftovers and won?t be making this again, at least not as written. This will probably be due most often to one flavor being too strong. 1 -- Inedible. There?s a critical error in the recipe.",Contributor,4.6,212,2002-01-01,33,15,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/fruit-kebab.png,902

85817,21752,https://www.food.com/user/21752,Mirj2338,"Come and visit me on my blog:  www.miriyummy.wordpress.com   October 2011: It's been 10 years since I came into Zaar one day at the recommendation of someone on another website. If you ask my husband (or my coworkers), I haven't logged out since! So what's happened in the ten years since I became addicted to Zaar? Well, I've been happily married, happily divorced, and happily married once again. (Wanna see wedding pictures? Click here.) Originally from the Bronx, I've been living in Israel since 1983. I'm married to a brilliant man with the most yummy British accent (this is the part where he rolls his eyes and says, Yeah, yeah, yeah). Let's call him Sushiman, even though he hates that name. Chia gave him that nickname when I was trying to create a dinner to show off my culinary talents. I posted here on Zaar with questions about the menu and since sushi was the main focus of the meal, he became Sushiman. That dinner was just the first of what I hope will become a lifetime of meals together. This is a picture of us taken in September 2005 in Kew Gardens in London. It my favorite picture of the two of us. This comes in as a close second, taken March 2009: I have 4 of the most gorgeous daughters in the known universe (tfu, tfu, tfu, that's me spitting three times to ward off the Evil Eye). Sushiman has 4 kids of his own, so together that makes us a family of ten, together with my dog and my step-dog (sadly, since I first wrote this my step-dog, Honey, crossed the Rainbow Bridge). We're the Brady Bunch on speed. Not all eight live with us, but everyone is in and out all of the time, so we're thinking about replacing our front door with one of those revolving thingies. If you need help figuring out the whole complicated mess, you can check out Miriyummy, A Guide to the Perplexed. Here are my four beauties -- from left to right: Adiya, Sara, Nomi and Tehila On March 18, 2009, my oldest, Sara, got married to Ariel. The wedding was a clash of cultures and traditions, and we had a blast! Over 500 people attended our little party... ... and Ariel was welcomed into our family in style! If you want to see the photo album from Sara and Ariel's wedding, just go here. We're just one big happy family, most of the time, really! Here on Recipezaar I am the host of the Kosher & Jewish Cooking forum. Come on in, and let the Jewish Mothers of Zaar feed you senseless! I hope you enjoy my recipes. I have only posted recipes of food that I am willing to eat myself. Therefore, you won't find anything unkosher in my recipes. You won't find any stinky bleu cheese or goat's cheese either. You will find a lot of comfort food, I believe that comfort food is very important. Gay and Troy are always thanking us for making Recipezaar such a great place. I firmly believe that it's Gay and Troy themselves that deserve a multitude of thanks, from us! And I hope I live up to their expectations!

So I had to decide what things had to go or be changed in my life. This one relates to YOU!. If you are kind enough to review (even take pictures, WOW!) of one of my recipes, please know that I thank you very much, but you might not get a response from me unless I have some spare time. So to all of you in advance, THANK YOU! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~UPDATE: ( Sept. 6th 2009 ) WOW! Another year older and still kickin'. It has been a very busy year as last August I opened Wag Time, a doggie day care and lodging business. It has grown from one or two dogs a weekend to seven fulltime weekday pups; every weekend; and lots of vacation stayovers! I have not had a free day since Memorial Day....and I'm not complaining! Even had to hire a partime helper! So now with my four students and lots of dogs, I'm enjoying each and every day. But....other than not getting much of a social life with family and friends, I have much less time to spend on Zaar. Each time I get on, there is so much going on, so many new faces that I never see all of it. To all my loving friends on CC, please know that you are not forgotten, just on hold for a while. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I finally made it! Not that I REALLY wanted too...but somethings you have no control over. There were times that I worked really hard to avoid it, and other times when I just threw up my hands and said a big, So What! There have been those in my life that said it really doesn't matter...and yet...Oh, what am I talking about? My 65th birthday, what else? I still think it is a mistake! I DO believe my husband was sitting around the big dinner table in the sky and he told the angels that I love to pull a good prank and to get even with me for all I pulled on him, I became 65!. I know that is what happened cause everybody KNOWS I'm only thirty! Okay...forty. (Wow, this is outdated for sure!) Been cooking since I was ten, making the evening vegetable. By twelve I pretty much took over the family kitchen and I've been cooking ever since! Love all kinds of food but probably favor Asian-style cuisine the most. I LOVE to create my own thing..from breakfasts to midnite snacks and everything in between. Have six grandchildren and WAS busy making that expected cookbook for them, but I have most of it here on Zaar now. I say most of it cause I'm not finished creating different things. Guess there is only one food item that I stay strictly away from and that is okra, otherwise I'm open to try most anything...well at least a healthy taste! Update 2007: After trying to use this food item in different recipes, I have to add blue cheese to keep the okra company. Retired from a long nursing career due to poor eyesight and now am a SAHM - YES, I AM! I have international students in my home and I'm the Big Mamma!. Get lots of original recipes through them and always try to cook foods from their homelands. Due to their different likes and dislikes, I am always tweaking recipes. For the past several yrs, I have changed my eating patterns for a more healthly life style. Each New Year resolution was bringing me closer to reaching my goal. I have now stopped my changes as I feel (and my doctor) that I am in the best control in my adult life. My weight is stable at 150 (give or take a lbs or two), and at 5ft,6inches, I'm happy. My cholestrol is about the same as my weight. My B/P still needs help with some medicine, but is maintained. Only my eyes cause any problem. So after the last few years of problems, I'm grateful that God has allowed me more time to show him that I am trying to take care of the body he gave me. It sure helped to have so many Zaarites supporting and befriending me.",Contributor,4.5,,2004-12-01,2,23,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/drink.png,2222

When I asked him where he got the name from, his reply was ""It was on a Dr Suess tape my momma got me at the Library"". :lol: I thought it was so cute that I decided to use it on the internet. I babysat for that family for 8 years!! That little boy is now in middle school. I still see him and his family every now and then. His mom and I keep in touch over the phone.

I enjoy trying new recipes and can't wait to get my son into it as well. I really enjoy baking most of all, but I find lately I am getting more into cooking as well. And I dabble in food photography so I love to get pics of the dishes I prepare. I have found so many great recipes here and I just want to say Thank You! I try a new recipe almost every night. I have started submitting some I have around here and trying to create some of my own as well so if you try any of them I hope you will like them as much as I have enjoyed all of yours. I worked as a Barista for a couple of years and I love to mix drinks up and try all sorts of flavor combinations. I am thinking about trying to start up a cooking club in my area! I am really excited about it but I am waiting until my son is a bit older and we are in the process of selling our house so I wanna wait til that is done. It will be a meet once every couple weeks or once a month sort of thing and we will all get together and prepare new dishes planned around themes. I think it will be a lot of fun! I often bore my friends talking about food so much lol. I just love to talk about recipes and the different foods out there. Lately I have joined in on many zaar games and events and am having loads of fun! It keeps me rather busy just keeping up with the threads and making so many recipes lol. But I have found MANY wonderful recipes because of them. Here is a pic of my son Perrin I took the this January. This past year I have started my photography business. It has been a lot of fun, and I hope to continue to grow with it all. I am an on location natural light photographer specializing in children, families, seniors, newborns, etc. It is such a great thing to be able to do something you love and still be able to be a SAHM which is something that is very important to me. And who doesn't love to be their own boss??? lol MY RATING SYSTEM: 5 stars ~ An incredibly delicious recipe and something I would make for company. Also the deciding factor from 4 to 5 stars is simplicity! If its super yummy AND simple to make it gets 5 stars by me! 4 stars ~ A great recipe and one I would make again. I may have made a couple small changes however to our tastes. 3 stars ~ A pretty good recipe, but not one that I would most likely make again only because I already have so many others to try, and our favorites to make again and again. Also probably needed to leave out a few too many things or add in a few of my own to get it to our tastes. 2 stars ~ Just not for us. We ate it, and tried it according to recipe directions, but the flavors or textures or some other aspect were just not something we enjoyed. 1 star ~ I wouldn't normally give a 1 star, but it would have to be a messed up recipe to get one. lol Create your own visitor map! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I have participated in the following...

The 2nd is poor reviews when changes are made that change the recipe and then the reviewer wonders why it didn't turn out. Sometimes it just might be personal taste - but you can't know with out at least a short comment. Figured I should say that my rating system pretty much just follows the Zaar list. Rarely will I ever rate anything less than a 3 or 4 as I can tell by the ingrediants if I'm going to like it or not.

We live in Southern, Ontario.  I live to cook and just love to putter around the kitchen. I enjoy reading all kinds of cookbooks which I borrow from the library or buy second hand. I really like Taste of Home magazine, because the recipes are from ordinary people and aren't too complicated. I also like to read community or church cookbooks because you know that the recipe must be special for someone to share it. I discovered RecipeZaar because it was mentioned by someone in a cooking magazine...now I am hooked. I think it is so helpful to read the reviews and suggestions from others who have tried recipes before me. I always thought of myself as a pretty good cook, but I am learning so much since I have joined RecipeZaar.

I also left with full intentions to return to college & work on my degree ... until I ended up pregnant. Again. Our son was born this Aug. '09 and he is beautiful, healthy, just wonderful! We're so blessed. :) My husband is a United States Marine Corps veteran, having toured Iraq twice -- the second time while I was pregnant with our daughter. But he's back safe and sound. We are so lucky and have much to be thankful for! My favorite TV channel of all time (when I have time to watch) is Food Network ... it's what got me ""into"" cooking to begin with. My favorite celebrity chefs are: Rachel Ray (I think I like her personality more than her food though), Giada DeLaurentiis and Ina Garten. The latter two have made some great things. I am currently on a low-fat diet but indulge sometimes ... I have a b-i-i-i-g sweet tooth! (Maybe I should say that I just have a whole mouthful of sweet tooths ... er ... teeth). As for my biggest pet peeve in life? Well ... it doesn't have too much to do with food (depending on how you look at it) ... but it's the hiccups. I hate hearing them and I hate having them! But when I eat or drink (or laugh) too much ... they're just inevitable. I also hate it when I am looking very forward to eating something in the fridge ... and its GONE by the time I get to it (my husband is always the culprit, but he tries to blame the baby).",Contributor,4.2,,2006-05-01,0,0,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pasta.png,2962

86111,293410,https://www.food.com/user/293410,White Rose Child,"A teenager who loves to cook- weird or what? But yes, it's one of my passions! To me cooking is like an art form- there's always something new and exciting to try, and there are constantly more ideas running around in my head than I know what to do with. Now, to update this page- a little task I haven't done in about two years!! Much remains the same as when I joined what seems like ""forever ago"": I'm a vegan with many passions: music, yoga, volunteer work, healthy/tasty food (the healthy vs. the tasty seem to run in cycles, haha) - and perhaps most of all, I love the written world. My dearest happy moments are when I am reading, writing, and feeling inspired. I'm in my first year studying at Mount Allison university for a B.A., major in English. However, since this is RecipeZaar, I must note that I'm equally obsessive about food!! Six years have passed since I was twelve and sort-of accidentally converted my family to veganism. Yes, even dad and little bro now greedily dig into their tofu shepherd pie and soy ice cream (well, clearly, one AFTER the other). I'm always on the lookout for foods that will please, and maybe even be healthy for, all of us! Now that I'm in uni and living with my aunt, uncle and cousin in New Brunswick, I still try to help with the cooking a bit. My sweetie cousin, Bilious Pigeon here on Zaar, is a terrific kitchen buddy. We share a penchant for fine coffee. Thankfully, my family here has turned mostly to the vegan side and that makes university life sooo much easier! My posted recipes, those I haven't invented, might come from Vegnews magazine, another website, one of our awesome vegan cookbooks, or friends- but it's virtually guaranteed that I've modified them at least in some way, and if from a book or show, I always acknowledge the original source. After all, I'd want someone to do the same for me. Since returning to the public education system after eight years of homeschooling, I don't have quite as much time in the kitchen as I used to. But I don't let that stifle my creativity! One of my favorite activities is in the summer when I get together with another cousin ~Harriet~, who's also here on Zaar, and we cook as much as we want. Good times! One more thing about me. I'm a Zaar game addict. And proud of it, and I'd advise anyone to join who would like more reviews on their own recipes, not to mention spending time with fun people and trying recipes they might not find otherwise. Please Zmail me with any questions or just to chat. Hope you enjoy, and are inspired by, my ideas!",Contributor,4.6,,2006-02-01,32,23,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/fruit-kebab.png,619

I like to cook simple clean food. I usually don't use any packaged or processed products. Most of the time I make everything from scratch. I use only organic meat and dairy products and many other organic products and I believe it makes a big difference not only healthwise but also in taste. We have two kids. A 3 year old and a 9 year old. I try not to adapt the food for them too much. They are used to eating what we eat. Growing up I didn't really learn how to cook. At least I didn't care enough to remember anything.But living centrally in Germany I was able to travel and eat European food in it's respective Countries: Italian food in Italy, Spanish food in Spain, French food in France and so on. I really missed that when I moved to the States. I started cooking the week after I got married and have been cooking and teaching myself ever since. Now cooking is not only one of my two hobbies (photography being the other one)but I also see it as therapy. It calms me down after a stressful day, it cheers me up when I feel down and it helps me center my thoughts when I have a lot on my mind. :) Thank you so much to whoever gave me the gift of premium membership.

I have met many nice chefs while participating in the contests. I think it is unfair when chefs change an original recipe and then give a low rating. The way I will rate recipes: 5***** Delicious Recipes that we enjoyed and will want to have again and again. 4****Recipes that I would make again but make some changes. 3***Recipes that I would probably not try again without some major changes. I will not give a 1 or 2 rating as I know that the chefs that took time to enter the recipe felt it was deserving to share.

My life consists of school, work, and theatre. Moving to a new town and a new school half way through high school turned out to be a great event and I am very happy with my new life. I work at Papa Murphy's Take and Bake Pizza and absolutely love my job. It is the perfect job for me at this point in time. Since the town is pretty small, the shop has become a favorite and we have lots of regular customers which is awesome. If you haven't ever had Papa Murphy's before then you should most definitely try it because it is the closest you can get to homemade pizza without making it at home! As a first hand source, I can tell you that the dough is all made, cheese shredded, and veggies cut all in-store. My favorites are the Papa's favorite, gourmet veggie, and cheesy bread! I just love experimenting and creating new tasty combinations, but I also get to take home the mess-ups:) I have already decided that I want to be a diner owner and baker or someday (or something along those lines). I don't know if I'll get there, but that's what I wanna do. My mom has taught me everything I know, she supports me, and she always makes sure I'm happy. I could never thank her enough for what she has done for me. I also watch TV, not much, but there are a few shows that I absolutely have to watch (American Idol though it's over now and Hell's Kitchen). I also love Food Network and HGTV! I love Christmas, Thanksgiving, and Easter; mainly because those are the 3 holidays that my entire family gets together on and they're the big food holidays. I'm also very lucky because I have already traveled a lot inside the country mainly, but I have been to 3 of the islands in the Caribbean and Mexico. My absolute favorite places so far are California, Mexico, the Bahamas, Florida, Virginia, Colorado, and Oklahoma. When traveling, I love anything outdoors; skiing, the beach, amusement parks, national parks (Yosemite, Mesa Verde!). I used to think my mom was trying to make our summer vacations all 'educational', and now I can see that she WAS trying to teach us something, but I look back on those times and realize how great the places were. Williamsburg in Virginia and Eureka Springs in Arkansas are two of the cutest towns I have ever seen! If I could meet any 3 people in the world, I would wanna meet Paula, Jamie, and Bobby Deen:), but I'm probably not alone on that.",Contributor,4.3,,2007-03-01,0,5,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/taco.png,1511

I didn't have any so he gave me his and I was happy to get them!8-) We have two other boys, JJ and Andy who are a daschund and a maltese respectively. JJ left us to go to doggy heaven in 2004. Now we have another Maltese and her name is Keisha. I usually call her ""Keter-bug"". I worked with developmentally delayed individuals in a state Human Development Center for 12 years and wouldn't change it for anything else. My favorite cookbook would have to be Joy of Cooking because it's like a Cook's Bible...if you can't find something anywhere else you will find it in there. I don't use it all the time but if I have a question it's the first place I turn. The one I use the most is a Louisiana Junior League cookbook called ""Cotton Country Cooking"". It has everyday food in it that is what we like to eat the most. I've cooked just about anything I can think of from lobster to raccoon. We even cooked turtle. The thing that I really get peeved about is when people try to be someone they aren't. If you are just yourself you'll come a lot nearer to being who you want to be which is probably accepted and liked by all. I'd like to go to Europe if I had a month off. I've always wanted to go to France because that's where one side of my ancestors are from, England and Wales since that is where the other side originates and then Scotland where even others are from.

A wonderful, generous, kind anonymous person gifted me with PM and I can't wait to use all the features. Thank you! I might add a couple notes or links to my page here such as forums I frequent, fave searches, and helpful info. Update March 2008: I was given the opportunity to join my very first recipe swap (I added the banner below, thanks Um Safia) This swap was really fun, interesting, and helpful. Lots of great recipes to choose from and lots of exposure for my own. I thought I'd update this a bit. It's April of 2007 already (wow!) and I might have written the stuff below at least a year ago, and longer. I live in AZ, with a roommate and a nice boyfriend. My roommate has only tried my cooking once, but my bf, bless his heart, tries really hard to tolerate it, lol! He's a good cook in his own right, but me, I'm still a newbie cook at heart. I still enjoy 'zaar and sometimes spend hours and hours on here, as it's still friendly, helpful, and interesting. :) Also, this is late in saying, but I'm supposed to be on an IBS-safe diet consisting of no dairy, egg yolks, caffeine, red meat, too much fat, everything I love, etc.... so I'm working on it, it's taking me years and years, but I've incorporated this kind of diet into my other eating, and if my tummy gets mad at me, well, I only have me to blame. :/ I've been married for almost two years and it's the first time I get to really cook for someone other than myself. (Hehe, I signed up with here not too long after I wrote this, now I'm separated - not because of my cooking lol - but surprisingly found myself again, acting as 'housewife'.) I'm not a great cook, but I do follow after my mother, who tends to estimte her ingredients and taste as she goes, but she and my sister are two of the best cooks I know. The best rule of thumb for seasonings is always add too little, you can always add more, but can't always take away if there's too much. I mostly try other recipes I find, but now and then experiment with whatever I have available if I can't get to the store or am broke, and sometimes come up with pretty good recipes. I also have a hard time cooking usually, it takes me longer than most people as I am legally blind and have no depth perception so sometimes it's hard for me to measure and prepare food. Any of the recipes I post might be estimated unless otherwise stated. Sorry for the inconvenience. :) I found this place doing one of my recipe searches. It looks like a fun place to get recipes.

We have 4 children and 3 grandchildren. I have worked for a pasta company for a good number of years - very proud of the hard work everyone has done to grow this company that began as a farmer owned co-operative. If you buy the store branded pasta at a chain grocery store in the US, there's a very good possibility you have eaten pasta made in ND. We also make a lot of pasta for a good number of chain restaurants you may have eaten at. I very much enjoy cooking and baking. I find Zaar to be a plethora of interesting and smart people willing to share not only recipes, but a lot of knowledge that help me grow my own skills, tempts me into trying new things and help in making better choices. I also enjoy reading and sewing (quilting mostly) and a little gardening. Trying to learn knitting - my granddaughter, who is six, has asked for a sweater. I figure if I start on an adult sweater now, I might have one done for her when she graduates high school! Recipe rating I use (borrowed from Tish's page) 5 stars - This recipe is perfect. I would recommend it to others and would definitely make again. 4 stars - This recipe was good but I would change something in it next time. 3 stars - This is a recipe I would not make again but it was ""OK"" 2 stars - This recipe I would not make again and we didn't like it at all 1 star - This recipe did not work out/taste was unappealing and I wouldn't make it again",Contributor,,USA,2003-04-01,14,0,"http://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/h_120,w_160,c_fill,q_92/v1/avatars/21_medthumb_hor.gif",2719

86444,182010,https://www.food.com/user/182010,Chef Kate,"I have always loved to cook. When I was little, I cooked with my Grandmother who had endless patience and extraordinary skill as a baker. And I cooked with my Mother, who had a set repertoire, but taught me many basics. Then I spent a summer with a French cousin who opened up a whole new world of cooking. And I grew up in New York City, which meant that I was surrounded by all varieties of wonderful food, from great bagels and white fish to all the wonders of Chinatown and Little Italy, from German to Spanish to Mexican to Puerto Rican to Cuban, not to mention Cuban-Chinese. And my parents loved good food, so I grew up eating things like roasted peppers, anchovies, cheeses, charcuterie, as well as burgers and the like. In my own cooking I try to use organics as much as possible; I never use canned soup or cake mix and, other than a cheese steak if I'm in Philly or pizza by the slice in New York, I don't eat fast food. So, while I think I eat and cook just about everything, I do have friends who think I'm picky--just because the only thing I've ever had from McDonald's is a diet Coke (and maybe a frie or two). I have collected literally hundreds of recipes, clipped from the Times or magazines, copied down from friends, cajoled out of restaurant chefs. Little by little, I am pulling out the ones I've made and loved and posting them here. Maybe someday, every drawer in my apartment won't crammed with recipes.

I did spend three months renovating the kitchen and it is very retro. It is bigger than the hobbit house kitchen, but still small. I also finished another degree - this time in small business and am now currently working full time on my small mobile art business. I sometimes miss working with the elderly as a mental health therapist, but for the time being I am doing what I had always wanted to do for many years. Plus I am enjoying fixing up my new old house. 1/1/11 - Just a quick update on my profie, considering its been a few years since I updated. I still love to cook and we are currently looking for a new house, preferably another old house, but one with a larger kitchen. I have recently had some GI issues which are causing me to look differently at food. In the next few months you will start to see me post some new recipes that will be good, healthy and appropriate to those who suffer from digestive problems and IBS. I live in Michigan at this time, but have lived in several different states and countries. I like to cook and have recently been striving to cook healthy. I am an artist and therapist by profession. I enjoy walking, reading and making cards. I am also presently working on another degree to add to my collection of two bachelors and two masters degrees. The latest challenge is an online degree in small business management. I believe I probably cook in one of the smallest kitchens around. We live in an official bungalow, is even listed on the national registry. However, bungalow must mean very small, we nicknamed our house the hobbit house. The kitchen is equipped with a 1929 mini stove, limited pot space on the stove. We recently got a new refrigerator - almost standard size, except shorter - the old coil on the outside one died. I have so little room, I store the majority of my cooking items and can goods in the basement. My challenge is to be the best chef I can, despite my cooking environment. Some day I will have my dream kitchen, in the meantime, it is a snap to reach from the sink, to the stove, to the frig.!",Contributor,4.7,212,2008-03-01,0,18,https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/q_92/v1/food_avatar/780172/6bvkPmZ5SMCWOdz9hlX2-IMG_0448.jpg,1992

Maxx was the best dog that anyone could ever hope to have in their life.  Until we meet again, sweet boy, you will be forever in my heart and memories. I currently live in the country with two dogs (a 12 pound poodle mix named Suki and a new member to the family, a 7-month old(?) 7.5 pound terrier mix named Angel ).   I got Angel from the dog pound a week after I lost my beloved Maxx.  Suki and I both needed a new companion to help us cope with our loss.  Nothing will ever replace Maxx, but she has helped to uplift Suki's spirit. I am a secretary for a county school board. I love to cook, bake, crochet, paint, sew, read and anything to do with crafts. I was born in Tokyo,Japan. My father was in the Air Force and my moher was Japanese. I love to cook (and eat) a variety of foods from many different nations. I especially like trying out new recipes and experimenting with both old and new recipes. I also love participating in the great Zaar events like the tag games, recipe swaps, and Zaar World Tours.

Anyway, as to my years in the State Park System (retired now), I was responsible for 4 restaurants/dining rooms on my park and my boss at Central Headquarters said I should spend less time in my kitchens and more time tending to my park budget. I spent 25 years in those kitchens and worked with some really great chefs over those years, (and some really awful ones too!) I spent THOUSANDS of hours on every inch of that park and adjacent state forest (60,000 acres) and sometimes I miss it. But mostly I miss being in that big beautiful resort lodge kitchen. I miss my little marina restaurant down on the Ohio River too. I served the best Reuben Sandwich (my own recipe -- posted on 'Zaar as The Shawnee Marina Reuben Sandwich) in both the State of Ohio and the Commonwealth of Kentucky down there and sold it for $2.95. Best deal on the river! They (friends and neighbors) call my kitchen The Ospidillo Cafe. Don't ask me why because it takes about a case of beer, time-wise, to explain the name. Anyway, it's a small galley kitchen with a Mexican motif (until my wife catches me gone for a week or so), and it's a very BUSY kitchen as well. We cook at all hours of the day and night. You are as likely to see one of my neighbors munching down over here as you are my wife or daughter. I do a lot of recipe experimentation and development. It has become a really fun post-retirement hobby -- and, yes, I wash my own dishes. Also, I'm the Cincinnati Chili Emperor around here, or so they say. (Check out my Ospidillo Cafe Cincinnati Chili recipe). SKYLINE CHILI is one of my four favorite chilis, and the others include: Gold Star Chili, Empress Chili and, my VERY favorite, Dixie. All in and around Cincinnati. Great stuff for cheap and I make it at home too. I also collect menus and keep them in my kitchen -- I have about a hundred or so.

One of my sons was a soldier in the Canadian military. I pray for all of our children who so bravely defend our way of life. I try to do something kind everyday. It really is nice to be nice. I detest pettiness, two faced people and dishonesty. I try to treat everyone I touch with the same respect I would like. Also I try not to sweat the small stuff.

Lolo used to make pickle fish. You would think that is a kids worst nightmare, but it was fabulous. I would kill for that recipe.My mother was also a wonderful cook. I grew up eating the most amazing food; her lasagna and Bolognese sauce are out of this world. I am originally from Argentina and living in Colorado for the past 25 years. As you can imagine, I love to cook, eat and entertain. I read cookbooks like novels. There is nothing that I enjoy more than traveling. I love the challenge of a new culture and a foreign language. Of course all my traveling is culinary oriented. Eventually I would love to move to Italy. Italians, in my opinion, have the perfect life style; Hard work in the morning, good food for lunch, nice siesta and out for a ""giro"" (go for a round) in the afternoons to visit with your friends over a cup of coffee. My daughter is a great baker; she has a natural talent for it. We can make the exact same recipe and hers ALWAYS tastes much better.

86641,2597942,https://www.food.com/user/2597942,rosie316,"(FYI Update: 06/03/14)... My About Me page is correct. I joined as a member on March 19, 2012 (2+ years ago). But if you click on my public recipes, it states that I joined on Dec 29, 2112. It's way off... but I'm sure the staff will take care of this issue soon. (I will remove this when this error has been corrected). Anyway...   Hi fellow chefs. Looking to expand here. Everyone on here has been a pleasure to meet & share recipes with. My hubby and I live in Northern Illinois USA, just NW of Chicago. I'm a very proud mom of 2 kids (my daughter in college & my son in highschool). I also have 4 semi step-children, from which we are now proud grandparents of a 4th grandchild (June 2013). I love to cook and experiment (using my family & friends as guinea pigs). If I had the time and $$$, I would spend all of it on creating dishes to feed people. I try to have family and neighbors over whenever possible to feed them. I've cooked many large meals (at home) to take to our county's women/children's shelter, and also to the homeless men that spend 1 night, (once a week), in the local church basement. It's the right thing to do (when you can afford to do it). I love to throw a party, even when it isn't a holiday. Cookouts in the summer or a bring a dish to pass type of get together or an appetizer only event, or even a fondue party. But my favorite... a rolling dinner party ... that's when each of our neighbors who participate pick a dish, and we walk to their home to have cocktails at house #1, then on to house #2 for appetizers, then house # 3 for soup & salad, house # 4 is the entree, and finally house # 5 is dessert! Now keep in mind, we take house #1's cocktails with us when we go on to the next few houses! LOL It's alot of fun. Try it sometime. We usually do it the weekend before Christmas and then go caroling the neighborhood. It's hilarious... grown adults, with full bellys, withstanding temps in the single digits, singing to the community! Sorry folks, I tend to ramble. Anyway, in any spare time, I love to garden. Flowers, veggies and herbs. Always planting in the spring/summer when I can. My bucket list includes making a Moon Garden. Not the kind that some farmers use as a planting chart, but a garden containing flowers, herbs and veggies that are white or somewhat white in color, and they glow beautifully under the moonlight!  Hubby and I are caretakers for a little cabin, up north of us, in Wisconsin. It is truely a thing to see. Located on 40 acres (formerly a paper mill plantation). Huge pine trees abound and so very peaceful. The downside is... NO electricity and NO running water. That's correct... we literally have an outhouse (like a skinny, wooden shed with a hole beneath it and a crescent moon cut in the door). Ewww. Sorry. We use propane to grill with, and have a oil burning stove in the little 2 room cabin. We also use a charcoal grill or our wood smoker, on which we make a brisket every time we go up there. Another favorite thing to make are Pudgie Pies using cast iron pie irons over the open firepit!... Google them... they are fun and tasty! We also have a trailer set up for the youngsters that has a propane stovetop and oven. And when we go in the summer, there is a farm stand just 15 minutes away that we can get fresh produce from. It's great! And luckily, the public lake (2nd largest in Wisconsin) is only 20 minutes away. They have a beach with restrooms and showers. It's a blast going there. We take the kids and grandkids with on occasion and have a great time! We love to ATV around the trails on those 40 acres of heaven. Okay, on we go...I have been working independently as an owner/operator of a pet grooming salon for 20 plus years, which is why I now have a Chinese Crested dog, (pretty much hairless, so basically, no real grooming involved). We also have a cat, 4 ducks & drakes, and 2 chickens. Oh... and a $0.15 cent goldfish that I bought from the pet store, because he was too cute to be in the stores feeder fish tank. The old one lived 3 yrs and had passed, and grand-babies missed seeing him. I got a new one. The new one with us still doesn't have a name.  So, there you  have it... thats me. -Rosie My rating/review system is as follows: 5 stars - Excellent, as is. Would not change a thing. 4 stars - Very good, liked by most. 3 stars - Good, but needs to be altered on some things. 2 stars -  It could have potential, but not for me. 1 star - Will not attempt again. 0 stars - I only post a reply without stars to comment, as I do not want to mess up someone's rating.",Contributor,4.9,212,2012-12-01,2,14,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/sushi.png,1041

I feel very strongly about food and how it affects us...I think of it as medicine...the food you eat can be just as effective for the maintenance of your health as any prescription drug! And who wouldn't want to use nutrition as a way to avoid disease so that you end up taking less pills later in life? Health was my motivation for giving up dairy and eggs...and, although I don't make it a habit to go around shouting at people that they should eat this and avoid that, it does make me happy when people make the right choices for their health! Hmmmmm. pet peeves? If I had a dollar for every time since I gave up meat that someone asked me, ""Well, what DO you eat, anyway?"" I could retire to a tropical island! I guess it bothers me that people are so ignorant of the choices that are available to them. And it shocks me that there are people out there who have no clue how to read a label, deciding whether something has too much fat or sodium (or whatever) for them to consume! I knew a woman who thought her potato chips were healthy because ""it said no trans-fats"" on the bag! I always dreamed of becoming a dietician so I could help that kind of person, but have been disinclined to pursue it because of the time to earn the degree, the low pay most of them receive and the general feeling that no one will listen to me, anyway! For fun, I like to hang out with my dogs, cook for people (especially veg people!), read, make jewelry, watch British comedy on TV, go out shopping with friends at places like junk stores and ethnic markets, and tons of other stuff! I stay pretty busy! Fave restaurant...Sage in Chapel Hill...if you live around here, I encourage you to check it out! Beautiful food, great atmosphere, even if it is on the small side, and the proprietor is the most gorgeous man! And everything on the menu is vegetarian or vegan...I feel so free when I walk in there...it's amazing! For food shopping, I like Whole Foods the best. Trader Joe's is not as veg friendly, but they have good prices on many staples that I use. Some of the mainstream stores are even catching on...we have a Food Lion near us way out here in the boonies that has a whole natural foods area that allows me to purchase many vegan specialty items without making a long drive to town! Love that! Amazon.com is great for non-perishable foods...they have that subscribe and save program for many grocery items and it is a real savings!

My mom is Dutch and has moved to England in October 2007, after living 15 years in the Netherlands with my English dad. They don’t have any human children and “created” their own family, which means I have to share them with Hannah, she is a 6 years old tortie cat, Abby the dog, she is a 9 year old Beagle, and a one year old black Miniature Pincher named Poppy, I refuse to tell you my age but I am a georgious lilac British Shorthair cat!! It is obvious she adores pets just by looking at her name she uses on Zaar (many on Zaar call her Pets or Petsie Poo), her name in real life is Annelies and that is a common Dutch name. My mom always liked to cook, but since she joined Zaar it got out of control, and it doesn’t help that she is disorganized. Printed recipes everywhere in the house, the recipe binders have got bigger and just between you and me, her hips too!!! I have lived in Holland all of my life until now, but they lived in several different countries/places:- desert and coastal Oman, up North and West in Holland, Vancouver-Canada, Aberdeen- Scotland and in Norway they lived in Bergen and Oslo. We have all moved together to England, as you can see I’ve already learnt the language! I heard her say to Dad that this is the last time she moved to another country...she's had it with moving from one place to another!

My other half calls me his 1950's housewife because I just love to bake, preserve and cook in general! After studying catering at college I decided commercial cookery wasn't for me but I still like nothing more than discovering new dishes, throwing dinner parties and so on! I work on the recruitment side of a quantity surveying consultancy about 25 miles north of London. I love my job. It's hard work but fast paced, challenging and my work day just flies by. With regards to how I rate recipes, I try and keep it fair and to the system. I do my best to give no lower than 3 stars but will do on occasion if I made something as directed and it still ended up in the bin. I've never given 1 star but on occasion I'll leave no stars if I suspect something went horribly wrong.

Everyone has their own rating systems and that doesn't offend me.

I've always loved to cook for family and friends.  Back in the States, had a cookbook collection to rival any library, but sadly had to leave them behind when we moved here.  Fortunately, I'm discovering that all my favorite cookbook recipes are already somewhere on the inernet, so it's not so bad after all! Most of the time, I look at recipes just to get ideas and then go with it from memory or what's in the pantry.  Hubby is a great cook, too - and we make a wide variety of foods.  We especially love italian, greek, and mexican cuisines. Here in Costa Rica, it's difficult to find many of the foods we're accustomed to.  So I've learned to make many of the basics we used to take for granted, like ricotta cheese, hummus, tahini, teriyaki sauce, Rose's lime juice, and many liqueurs.  Thanks, Food.com for making my search for recipes easier! On the plus side, seafood and veggies are cheap and abundant - the only thing I miss is my USDA Choice ribeye, lamb chops and wild salmon from Costco.  Sob!",Contributor,4.7,212,2011-06-01,13,7,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pop.png,1743

I have also been very fortunate to have travelled extensively over the years.........I still have wanderlust! I used to be an English Literature & Art History teacher & lecturer; before that, I trained and worked as a Graphic Designer for many years. I now live in France with my husband & my daughter who has just started university in September 2006. We also have one very chatty Burmese cat Willow, who allows us to live with her here! (I used to have three cats, I recently lost Monty, a beautiful seal point Siamese and before that, Rama, who was a debonair blue point Siamese cat - I would love to have another Siamese cat or cats in the future!) This is my Burmese Cat, Willow, sunning herself on the log pile in the kitchen garden: Here is my lovely Monty, a seal point Siamese, and Willow, sitting in the kitchen garden last year, and a few months before Monty died; he was 18yrs old: My This is my wonderful old boy, Rama, a blue-point Siamese, who died when he was 20yrs old - excuse the old and much sellotaped photo: My favourite pastimes are: reading, writing, painting & drawing, photography, gardening, anything creative, walking, travelling, dining out and of course COOKING! I love all types of cuisine, but especially Traditional British - and NO it is NOT all bad!! I particularly love food associated with the changing seasons plus traditional feasts & festivals, as well as Slow Cooking. I also enjoy French & North African cuisine, come to think of it, there isn't much I don't like! My husband & I run a Chambres D'Hotes, (Bed and Breakfast) called Auberge de la Fontaine here in beautiful South West France; we specialise in Gourmet Food & Wine Breaks, French Antiques & Restoration courses, French Language courses and French Cookery classes. Our home is completely furnished with Antique French furniture that we have rescued & restored ourselves. Our charming village has one of the oldest Churches in the region & it is famous for its connection with the St.Jacques de Compostella Pilgrimage route, as well as being within the Cognac & Bordeaux wine growing area. We have a wonderful garden where we grow ALL of our own herbs and most of our fruit and vegetables. I specialise in rare, unusual and old-fashioned herbs, which I grow in our walled garden. As well as growing herbs, I also grow many different varieties of lavender, old-fashioned shrub roses and heirloom fruit and vegetables. We have lived overseas for many, many years now - but we both still love going home to Northern England, near Scarborough & York, to visit our family & friends. We also love indulging in dining out when we are there, in a wide variety of EXCELLENT Gastro-Pubs that we have in North Yorkshire; and popping in to have a Pint of REAL ENGLISH ALE in our local pub is a always a must!!

I just graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Human Nutritional Sciences in May 2008 after 5 years of hard work. My hard work paid off as I was accepted to a post graduate dietetic internship which I am currently completing and will be done in June. The internship allows me achieve professional designation as a registered dietitian. This is a very exciting but also a very busy time for me so I have not been contributing to zaar nearly as much as i'd like to. I have always loved baking and cooking and looking for healthier recipes or ways to make recipes healthier to fit into my lifestyle. I am pesco-vegetarian as I do not want animals to suffer for my consumption. I also love to be active in individual sports and train year round for triathlon. I am both an active racer and volunteer. The distance I prefer most is the Sprint distance - 750m swim, 20km bike, 5km run. This upcoming race season marks my 16th year of participating in triathlon. I love it just as much, if not more, than I did 16 years ago!! I also have a newfound love for Iyengar yoga. I have a profound love for animals and the pretty little kitty you see as my icon is my 16 1/2 year old cat Snuggles. Sadly, Snug passed away in March 2006, and is dearly, dearly missed.

Leslie dances away in a beautiful portrayal of a multifaceted, everyday sorta girl. Like Leslie Caron, I wear numerous hats. Some look better on me than others, but it’s still fun to try them all on! I live incessantly and I am wild, simple and beautiful, spiritual, exciting, lusty, sweet & shy, old fashioned, infectious & modern, yacky and moody. A little bit of everything all rolled into one. It can be difficult to sum up 25 years in a short biography. But it is interesting to look back and mull over the trials and tribulations I have gone through, the extent of how I have changed, the friends I have lost and the companions I have gained… I certainly never expected to wish I could be 12 again, or better yet, wish I had listened to my parents when they said things like ‘save your money’ or ‘do as I say, not as I do’. Because of this I try to live everyday knowing ‘I’m going to miss this’. Not remembering the past or worrying about the future but being present in the moment. In May of 2008 my husband (and high school sweetheart) and I adopted our puppy Kaya, and in August 2008 we gave birth to our first child. My definitions of love and happiness considerably changed the moment I first saw my son. The first few minutes of his brand new life created a new significance to ‘love at first sight’. I now know how it really feels to love somebody. I like to think that I can roll with the punches and blend in where needed. I route for Michigan football year after year (not the most exciting thing to mention right now), I’ve been known to kick some butt on Halo 3, I fired my first shotgun when I was 8 months pregnant and I get excited when I see snakes (but I freak out when I see roaches). Among the more boring traits, I enjoy reading anything from Harry Potter (yea, I know) to John Grisham. I should be a sales rep for Netflix, I’m their #1 fan. Oh, who started the rumor 'the way to a man’s heart is through his stomach' - I beg to differ! I am in no way a man, and I'd prefer a nice meal over flowers any day! I am terribly allergic to cats… and I prefer dogs over diamonds too. I am a stay-at-home-mom and presently I am attending college courses online: I will be graduating with an Associates Degree in Communications in July 2010. I love to write and look forward to making a career of it. I am also intrigued with the process of holistic living; perhaps a career within the realm of holistic health and nutrition would be a suitable addition to my studies :D",Contributor,4.9,212,2007-09-01,1,7,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/fruit-kebab.png,2576

I love to travel... sometimes just to pick a spot on the map and make a weekend out of it. Since I have been here, some of my favorite places to visit are Oregon and Washington (Cle Elum, Leavenworth, Spokane, Bonney Lake, Maple Valley, Issaquah, etc). My favorite place in Seattle is Pike Place Market, even though I don't get there often. And, Mt. Rainier is a scene I often photograph. Originally, I am from Jamestown, NY home of She is loved by all that live there and the surrounding areas! Another famous person that is from the area is Natalie Merchant and former lead singer of the 10,000 Maniacs (rock band). I think that is about it for famous people. There was a question posted in one of the forums about who I would love to have for dinner, right now. I answered God, Jesus, my mom, Grandma Lundin, Grandpa Lundin and Aunt Sig. They are my role models in life. Each has molded me into the person I am now. My fondest memories are spending Thanksgiving and Christmas-time at my Grandma's house, and the whole family around.

I grew up with a local manufacturer of machine/tooling systems soldering/wiring circuit bds and assembling whole systems. That wasn't enough for me so, I went to college and obtained my AAS in Electrical Technology. The same company hired me back to work in their service dept as a technician. I had planned to go further to become an electromechanical engineer for the company, but I was laid off.

Thankfully they are always willing to try new recipes I'm making. I really miss living in Germany and it was so much easier to make healthy meals there. I was spoiled to have so many fresh markets and a good selection of food to choose from. My husband and I love to travel and have been lucky to visit Germany, Spain, Denmark, France, and Sweden. We've been married for seven wonderful years (March 17, 2001). We don't have any children except our 2 dogs which think they are human and run the house. I have used Zaar for about 3 years and figured I should be a member to leave feedback for all the recipes I have used in that time. Group 2 Mates Sheynath, Chef floWer, Chef Kate and Joey - DragonFyre Group 10 Mates I'm Pat, NurseJaney, PollyW Swap Partner Sarah_Jayne My rating system This is the way I rate the recipes I make, I hope no one takes it personally if their recipe doesn't make the full 5 stars... 5 Stars = these recipes have to have the Wow, Wow, Wow factor. I'm saving five stars for the kind of dish you wish that there were 10 stars for... the kind of dish that you'd happily eat every day for 6 days in a row, that wouldn't be out of place coming from the kitcken of an excellent professional chef...or a more humble meal that's so popular that I'd get lynched if I didn't make it once per month (or more often) or which people ask for as a gift for their Birthday. 4 Stars = an excellent dish, but without the mega Wow factor... these are culinary delights that you'd enjoy often, but maybe not every month. These are recipes that you like & love but haven't quite reached the adore catagory. These are recipes that are earthly delights, but seperated from the heavenly delighful ones in the five star group. Nothing wrong with any recipe that gets my four star vote, I assure you. 3 Stars = recipes where some of my human guinea pigs were wildly divided in their ratings. Personal preference is a very tricky area, the distinct taste of various herbs, spices, vegetables, meats and their combinations is something that dosn't necessarily please everyone. If I award three stars then probably your favourite flavours just didn't match our favourite tastes or not enough of us liked it over all. Maybe this something that we all enjoyed, but comes into the catagory of would love this just several times a year Maybe I just couldn't replicate every single ingredient and this affected the result. If any of this is the case and the votes are split then I will aways give your recipe the benifit of the doubt and go for the higher star rating of the group.. and I'll let you know details in my review. 2 Stars = for whatever reason this recipe just didn't do it for us, flavours clashed, the flavour promised didn't deliver or something just plain went wrong. If you are receiving a two star review from me that please know that if the ingredients aren't too expensive, that I tired your recipe again with a few tweeks in the hope that I could modify it to suit us better (since there obviously was something in your recipe that caught my eye in the first place. Two stars means that the second attempt didn't work out either. I would try and tell you in detail what I had a problem with, and I'd try to do that as tactfully as possible. I'd hope you wouldn't throw your rolling pin at me for it 1 Star = give us food poisioning or put us in hospital with your recipe and it receives one star in a flash. (please know I am very careful when storing/preparing/cooking food) I take the health and wellbeing of my family and friends very seriously indeed. We will try very very hard to never have a one star review, yes? that would make both you and me very very very happy.

My husband, who is Puerto Rican, and I were married in May 2006. He is retired from the Army (24 years) and now works for TASC Inc. while I am a stay at home mom. this is a new lifestyle for me as I worked for 23 years before having a baby on Dec 20, 2008. She was born two months premature and while she was in the hospital I decided I wanted to be with her and so I stopped working. My husband and I both love cooking (probably him moreso than I) in our spare time. We purchased a home in 2006, and I think the main reason we bought the home is because of the beautiful kitchen...which is where we spend most of our time. We like to try new recipes and Recipezaar has made this easy for us. When we first met he moved to Alaska, and to bridge the distance we would cook (him in Alaska and me in Alabama) the exact same recipe from zaar while on the phone or web cam together. When we had more time we tried at least one new recipe a week. We are slowly but surely getting back to that tradition. Cooking together has become challenging with a 13 month old. One of us plays with her while the other cooking. I also enjoy collecting cookbooks and now I am addicted to Food Network.

87063,234912,https://www.food.com/user/234912,ChefRaylene,I love trying new recipies and have a 17 year old and a husband that will try anything once. Even my Mom will try just about anything and will help cook once in a while. I usually make my mom do a marathon cookie bake during the holidays. She groans but I think she really likes it. I grew up in Florida and moved to North Carolina 14 years ago. I love the beauty of the mountains and the seasons but small town living can be both a little boring and joyous at times. The seasons let you cook different foods; stews and casseroles become popular during the cold weather months and of course lighter dishes during the summer.,Contributor,4.6,,2005-08-01,0,1,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/burger.png,4311

I even appreciate the ones that tried them and for some reason they didn't work out for you.  Everyone has different tastes, and you can't please everyone all the time.   Lots of times people change the recipes, adding things, leaving things out, and not seasoning them to their own taste, and give a bad review...  Recipes are only guidelines, and if you follow mine and don't like it, then it's a personal preference as to why you don't like it, and I appreciate that.  However, if you don't follow my recipe then it is YOUR recipe that you don't like, and my recipe shouldn't be rated. IMHO   Thanks for trying them anyway  :) Hugs, Linda   My name is Linda. I am happily single, and I live in Rochester NH. I just moved back to the town where most of my family lived years ago, and where I lived as a child, after living in NC for 5 years. I have 2 grown sons, a dil, and 2 beautiful grandsons. I really enjoy my time here on Zaar posting recipes, trying new recipes, taking pictures, and reviewing lots of yummy recipes! I love to cook, and share recipes. The recipes that I share are mainly my own creations, or family recipes passed down to me from my mom and grandmother, and other family members or friends. If I post something from somewhere else, it has to sound REALLY good to me for me to post it! Many of the dishes that I prepare are simple, good, down home cooking. Many of them originate from New England, as my grandmother is from Maine, and my mother from New Hampshire. I do also like to try making some gourmet recipes as well, using my creativity along the way. I started cooking at a the age of 8, helping my mother and grandmother in the kitchen. My curiosity for cooking has led me to create many of my own recipes through trial and error. I hope you enjoy them as much as my family and I do :) In my spare time I play on my computer collecting recipes, and have been working on creating a cookbook to publish for some time, but have put it aside for now. I also love to travel and shop. I love to go to the beach and mountains, and as food is a passion of mine, I love to dine out and try many different cuisines in the area, and with friends when I am traveling :) I made my first herb garden in 2008, but have had vegetable gardens for many years in the past. I have done my share of canning and I love those fresh herbs and veggies all summer long! My Rating System: 5 Stars ***** Outstanding recipe that I absolutely loved. It can be down home or restaurant quality, as long as it tastes great and I didn't have to make any changes along the way! Also recipe has to have clear directions. One I would definately make again and again. 4 Stars **** Great recipe that I loved, but one that I may have had to tweak just a bit. Directions may have not been crystal clear. One I would make again and again with my changes. 3 Stars *** I liked the recipe, but had to add ingredients, or add more of a called for ingredient to have the recipe come out the way I like it. I would probably make again sometime. 2 Stars ** This recipe was ok, but I probably wouldn't make it again due to lack of taste, undesireable texture, or unclear directions etc. 1 Star * This recipe was one I didn't like at all. Either the amounts of ingredients were wrong (too little flavor or too much of one/some of the ingredients in the recipe), or the recipe didn't come out right following the directions given. Lack of directions.

I'm not quite sure exactly where this path will take me, but hopefully, if I'm good enough at it (and if the economy permits), maybe to an early retirement. :D My Rating System 5 stars: WOW! You don't have to have a recipe for the best thing I've ever tasted to get a 5 as long as there is something about it that honestly impresses me. 4 stars: I give four stars to recipes that are really good but have one thing or two that I would change. 3 stars: I give 3 stars to recipes that I feel are ""average"" or about the same quality as the everyday stuff my mom or I would make before I started looking for the best recipes on Zaar. 2 stars: I will probably never give a 2 star rating. If I feel your recipe was a 2-star, it is below average but not bad enough for me to tell you so. Thus, I might just never rate it. 1 star: Means the recipe had something significantly wrong with it that I believe others should be warned of. NOTE: Sometimes I will give extra stars on top of how I think the food tasted if I believe the lack of quality was due in part to a blunder of mine.",Contributor,4.5,,2008-05-01,0,12,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/taco.png,6

87220,111296,https://www.food.com/user/111296,Jociecee,"My name is Jocelyn and I have loved to cook for as long as I can remember. I started cooking when I was very young and have fond memories of a kindergarten field trip to a maple farm where we got some sap and took it back to school and boiled it down to make maple syrup. Then we mixed up some pancakes and each got a little dab of the syrup on our pancake. I am the oldest child and always helped my mother in the kitchen and could cook in elementary school. I have lived in New England all my life and love it! Western Massachusetts where I live is so beautiful and close enough to the other beautiful New England states and New York so that day trips and weekends in lovely old and new spots are always possible. I especially like to travel to Maine, Cape Cod, and Vermont. Being in New England means that you can be in the mountains or at the beach within an hour or two to enjoy the bounty that the New England harvest and catches provide. I collect cookbooks and my children probably think that I have too many. I love to try out new recipes and my children, twins Tatiana and William, and their little brother, Jared are willing mixers and taste testers. I enjoy all types of ethnic cuisines and love to experiment with different herbs and spices. When I am not cooking and transporting my children to activities from ballet to soccer,I teach at a graduate school. I enjoy teaching and learning, and I am thinking about going to get another graduate degree. src=http://i68.photobucket.com/albums/i25/bayhill/Zaar%20Icons%20and%20Greetings/gs2009jane.jpg>",Contributor,4.4,212,2003-11-01,1,1,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/burger.png,2808

We are currently house hunting and a dishwasher is a must (we don't have one right now). Luckily my dh is pretty good about helping out with the dishes :) I know it seems like I give lots of good reviews, but there is a good reason: I know what we like, so I pick dishes I think we will like, and often we do. If i give a review of a recipe with no stars it's because I think I did something wrong usually so that's why it didn't come out right. Or if something has excellent ratings and I don't like it, I don't want to ruin that, because obviously I didn't like something, but that's not a refection of the actual recipe! I dislike when people don't make the recipe correctly and give it a bad review. Ok, if you change one or two small things, fine, but if you make major changes, not ok.

I've since moved to the east coast to a small village in Northern Virginia - a huge change! We moved here mainly so we could live in an area better suited to raising children and closer to family. Although it's an adjustment, we really love it here. My husband and I were married in Feb 2003 and had our first daughter, Kylie, in Aug 2004. Our second daughter, Katie, was just born in July 2006. I was an HR Director until I became Mom, and I wouldn't trade this job for anything in the world! I began cooking when I became a stay-at-home-mom, mostly out of necessity. We used to eat out for every meal...and I do mean EVERY meal. When our income was cut in half after my ""early retirement"", eating out was no longer an option. Therefore, if I was going to continue to eat all the delicious food I was accustomed to, I was going to have to...oh, the horror!!!...COOK IT MYSELF!!!

To my utter surprise and delight (not to mention my husband's SHOCK and delight)...I loved it!

I have a fondness for animals, charitable works, and my family. I have to reign in my love of cookbooks because I would buy them all if I could - my current favorite is Recipezaar. (Go figure!) I've never seen anything like it and it's just wonderful! Notes on my ratings: In terms of cooking skill I rate myself a ""good cook"". In terms of taste, well....I like what I like so it's subjective. (If my picky DH gives something a thumbs up and/or my children also like it - that's a bonus but I rate on my own experience.) When I read a recipe I get a sense of what I THINK it should taste like. If I make the recipe, don't experience any trouble in the making of it, and it tastes like I'm expecting then it's 5 stars. If it tastes like I expect but I had some issue in the making of the recipe, which I will document, then it's 4 stars. 3 stars would mean it's middle of the road. Tasted okay, worked okay, but it didn't set my tongue on fire. 2 stars is going to be an overall disappointment, most likely in taste. 1 star - I hope never to give any recipe 1 star. With luck I would ""know"" that the mix of ingredients or what have you isn't going to work for me.

I've been married to my high school sweetheart for 21 years and we have twin boys who are 15 years old. Dh and I are partners in our own company and own 10 Subway sandwich shops. I work from our home handling all the financial and clerical duties of the business. Over the years and especially since finding Zaar, cooking has become my passion. My grandmothers were very good cooks and I have fond memories of the meals they prepared. We love entertaining and nothing pleases me more than having my family and others enjoy the food I make. I love it when the house smells good with dinner or whatever is baking. I came upon recipezaar searching for a rhubarb cake recipe one day. The recipe I chose was a 5 star and my addiction began. It took a few months before I started really utilizing the site but once I did my cooking has never been the same. My family now knows all about having to rate recipes, picking their favorite chefs, etc. It's become a family thing and they have told me that I may never let my membership to Recipezaar ever end. We love to travel and try to go whenever we can. Owning our own business has helped free up time where we can travel more. We've done some Europe, Canada, and much of the U.S. In the coming years I hope to do a lot more. Eating out when we are traveling is the best. I'm trying to learn more about the restaurants and chefs in places we are visiting so we can try and visit those restaurants and enjoy some of the great places our town just doesn't have. The whole family loves to ski and we look forward to the season every year - it makes winter tolerable. The kids are very involved in sports so we're always running to one game or another.

Marinade is a liquid mixture (usually vinegar, oil, and herbs) in which meat is soaked before cooking. Marinate is the corresponding verb (i.e., to soak in marinade).",Contributor,4.6,212,2003-12-01,0,23,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/burger.png,1970

Community suppers, Beef Pit Barbecues, Church suppers, potlucks, tea and bake sales, booths at the curling and hockey rinks in winter, the ball games in summer. What is truly the spirit of Saskatchewan is that these events are for most part the efforts of community volunteers sharing their time as well as their best make and takes. Small communities along with the larger centres across the province are well known for their turkey suppers, cabbage rolls, perogies and overflowing dessert tables. Homemade of course! I love preparing meals for my family and friends and in the sharing of good recipes be they mine or that of another. My posted recipes are recipes that are family favorites. My reviews here on Zaar allow that I have been most fortunate in the choosing of the recipes I have made. Without doubt we all love those over the top desserts and dishes to serve on special occasions and for those fives are a given. For me equally important are the recipes used in the daily meal preparation. Recipes enjoyed by my family be it a simple soup, salad or casserole are right up there with the 'over the tops' and share equal billing.

Aside from cooking and baking I admit that my interest in gardening exceeds that of the norm.

87464,246844,https://www.food.com/user/246844,little_wing,"I am a single mom of a 15 yr old and work as a CT technologist at hospital and at a cancer facility. I don't see cooking as a chore, I really do enjoy it. I am pretty much teaching myself as I go and have a lot to learn. I need to learn how to choose the right cut of meat. I always hear about how you should make good friends with your butcher. However, I'm afraid of annoying anyone with access to very sharp knives so I always take whatever is wrapped up and ready for sale. Lately, I have been trying to educate myself to be more eco-friendly in the kitchen. The more I learn, the more sense it makes not just for the planet but for my wallet! The hardest part so far has been trying to buy local and what is in season. I was looking at the fish at the seafood counter and everything except for cod had been imported from other countries. Thialand, Vietnam, ect. And all those lovely exotic ingredients in the produce section are very tempting! Another thing that's been frustrating is trying to reduce the amount of packaging my stuff comes in. Why do companies over-package everything?? The composting and recycling are working out great though, and I really encourage people to give it a try. I think a lot of people are reluctant to make greener choices because it seems like a tremendous amount of work and the effort seems overwhelming. But you can just start small. Pick one thing and go for it. Even if you don't make any other changes, you are still doing something! But chances are you will think of one more thing you could be doing. And then one more...it really get addictive because you see how easy it is and you feel good about yourself! For me, it started with just buying one or two reusable shopping bag each week at the grocery store. Within a month or so, I had enough to never need the plastic kind again. I was completely surprised to find that this little change was not only better for the planet, but easier for me! Those bags are so much easier to carry and they hold more stuff so you don't have to make as many trips from the car to the kitchen. Plus, I always have them in my car and use them for all kinds of stuff...carrying my gym clothes, library books, games for roadtrips, ect. Have I sold you on them yet??? My absolute fantasy is to have a farm. I know it will never happen: I have absolutely no connection to farm life and no experience or knowlege to make one succeed. Not to mention, I have no natural talents for any of the skills required to run one. But the idea of living off the land, living simply and being self-sufficient is utterly appealing. I'd love to be able to grow my own food, learn to can and make locally-remarked-upon preserves. Bake bread and pies. Learn to quilt and knit and sew. Feed chickens and gather eggs. Milk cows. Rise and retire with the sun. Sit on my porch at the end of the day and...okay, you get the point. And I realize the reality isn't as romantic as I imagine, but I think it would still be a wonderful way to live. My dream man is a cross between John Walton and Charles Ingalls (too much seventies TV at a young age?) with a bit of Sam Elliot thrown in. Maybe more than a bit! If I ever win the lottery, I think I would quit my job and find work as a farm hand. Of course, that would require me to actually play the lottery. I live with my somewhat idiosyncratic daughter and my reclusive boyfriend. Daughter is very picky, boyfriend will eat anything, but isn't exactly overly effusive either. I, of course, am the normal one. We have some interesting uh...""discussions"". My rating system: To be honest, I never give 2 stars or less because of the chance it was a mistake I made with the recipe. Besides which, I am a coward. In those cases, I just leave a comment with no rating. I also try to save 5 stars for recipes that are truly extraordinary.

I grew up in California where I could eat Mexican food every day and the produce was amazing! My husband grew up in Zambia, Africa and had a wonderful adventurous childhood. I love to listen to his stories. Shortly after we got engaged we moved to Augusta, Georgia and it was a fun adventure for us and we loved the change and adored going to the Masters golf tournament, but after two years we REALLY missed the west coast so we moved to Oregon. For five years I was more than thrilled to be near Mexican food once again and the produce was also fantastic. Now we live in upstate NY where there isn't any Mexican food (can you tell I like Mexican?) but we do have Italian and I love it! Now if I can do something about the snow!! I've been married for 13 years to a wonderful man who is everything I ever wanted and more. We love to travel, which we did a lot of before we had our wonderful babies five years ago. My husband and I love culture when we travel and so we try to stay away from the tourist spots. A few years ago my husband went to Saudi Arabia on business so I decided I'd go to Peru to see Machu Pichu and Cusco--by myself. It was an amazing trip and I can't wait to go there again. Given our love for Latin food we've traveled through Central and South America. I LOVE typical dishes, especially in Costa Rica, and I'm prefectly happy to eat rice and beans over and over again. We built our home two years ago and it's on 22 acres so we're busy most weekends gardening and enjoying the outdoors.

I also love to read, write, travel, work on personal growth, and study/learn. I am a total water baby, who lives in the desert, so I love traveling to tropical locations, where I especially love to snorkle and boggie board! I am very happily married to my best friend, soulmate, partner, and greatest cheerleader and supporter, and we have three grown children, and four grandchildren (so far :-))I am a total foodie (I ""live to eat"" instead of ""eat to live."") :-) I love everything about food...cooking; the delicious scents of a yummy dish, as it cooks; the beautiful presentation of wonderful food; dining out; dining in; the taste of great food; sitting around the table, with friends and family, eating, talking and laughing; nurturing those I love by cooking for them...all of the senusal pleasures that food brings!

I'm fortunate to live close to the beautiful Wasatch Mountains and not too far from many beautiful national parks in the state of Utah. I feel we have a responsibility to reach out and help others, and as a follower of Jesus Christ, I hope to make a positive contribution to my family, local church congregation, neighborhood, community, and to worthy causes that inspire me. I find that many charitable organizations are not giving enough to help the less fortunate or to whatever is their cuase, but I really like The Smile Train, and the programs of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints which are mostly run by volunteers (main humanitarian missions... eyeglasses, clean water , Neonatal Resuscitation, Emergency Response, Wheelchairs, Food Production, and Immunizations).

I love ethnic foods of all sorts and love to try all sorts of new tastes.We try to eat light and healthy most of the time but once in awhile... I began my love for cooking and eating good quality foods as a young child. My mom loved to cook for us and since she came down with juvenile diabetes when I was 4 years old,she taught us all about nutrition. Both of my older brothers have a passion for great food as well and are terrific cooks.She never taught me to cook though! She said since she had to learn it on her own so should I.I started with baking and mastered it pretty well. I also made my first Thanksgiving dinner at 17. I became obsessed with nutrition and healthy eating as a teenager and managed to teach my mom a thing or two. As her tastes and cooking techniques changed so did mine. We spent a lot of our time together talking about food, trading recipes or eating.My parents always encouraged us to broaden our horizons and try any new food that came our way.I now have her recipe collection and plan on posting them here soon. I always told her they should be published! My other passions are gardening/landscaping, home improvement, decorating, antique collecting,fitness, my pets and my family to name just a few.

Used to work in a french restaurant in Downtown Chicago as a pastry chef but now I am a stay at home mom. I went to school for cuisine, not pastry, and actually I am much better at cuisine, however I've always wanted to study more pastry. I am not bad at it, I'm actually very good (tooting my own horn), but everyone says I have a natural talent for cuisine. Either way, I love cooking because it is my meditative time. However, when I cook at home, no one dares to walk into the kitchen because I am very bossy and they would rather not deal with me....heehee! I also love to craft, read, and write. I write a lot. Been working on short stories lately, but I've always been more of a poem freak. I love to read....I have a massive collection of books....every type of book. They are mostly cook books and poetry collections, but I also love history, religion, drama, suspense, romance (not the cheesy kind, my favorite book of all time is love in the time of cholera by gabriel garcia marquez, I have yet to see the movie), mystery, murder mystery (second favorite book is and then there were none by agatha christie).

I also love to garden and to cook. I started cooking in grade school, was fixing dinner every night as my “family chore” by the time I was in junior high, and have been enjoying it ever since. I think when you enjoy cooking, it is contagious. My married sons both share some of the cooking with their wives; my college daughter has enjoyed putting on Sunday Suppers in her dorm. Reading is also a favorite pastime, but my “reading” is done via books on tape since I am legally blind. I love Zarr because it allows me access to so many recipes, as well as the benefit of others’ experiences (thanks to modern technology and a specialty computer software program designed for the blind and visually impaired.

This picture was taken the 2nd night when we all ride through town and the residents come out to see us. Very cool! Now onto the real reason we're here... I'm a food lovin' gal who's looking for new great recipes that are fast, cheap and tasty. Oh and non-dairy is important as my husband's lactose intolerant. I have lived on Vancouver Island for my entire life.. have see scenery that many people will never ever experience thanks to growing up on the family boat pretty much year round, because of this I know that actual silence can be the most amazing thing and while so quite, so noisy at the same time... I love animals and currently I run a vet hospital which is enjoyable and stressing at the same time. (why can't everyone want to take care of their pets???) I am horribly in love with my DH and we're working on 5 years of marriage, not much for some, but most of our friends figured we'd have killed ourselves by now ( we're pretty good about not keeping things bottled up) We had the most fun wedding you could have imagined.. we even chose the songs WE wanted.... He walked down to the ""James Bond"" theme song and I walked down to ""Imperial March"". I have a 90 gallon fish tank and an adopted Mini Australian Sheperd called ""Ozzy"". Born March 28/06 he's well into his teens years mentality and has a couple of trust issues but wants to be a good dog. He's SUPER cute and VERY smart. I try to be healthy, I work out on occassion, but mostly try to eat healthy, which I find easy because junk food makes me feel crapy. I love music, pretty much everything, my favorite band is the Red Hot Chili Peppers. I love rock and oldies. I spend my childhood playing a huge list of instruments, from drums, to saxaphone and piano. I love to read but get VERY little time to do it. My favorite author is Clive Clusser, who writes the Dirk Pitt Novels, although I'm not a fan of his new novels, because its not him writing them. I am a ""Twilight"" addict. I also love ""Life of Pi"" and ""Self"" by Yann Martel. I read Mordaci Richler when I was 10 for fun, when most adults couldn't read it. I would like to someday read Moby Dick and War and Peace, just to say I've done it. Someday I might write a book myself. Who knows. My days are spent at work, my nights and weekends are spent taking care of the house and my DH. People ask when we're going to have kids and I say "" why? I married my child and he brings home an income"". My DH is a child at heart and while currently not involved in mixed martial arts fighting, which he loves, has taken a break to discover the wide world of paintball and dirtbiking. Either way, it keeps him out of my hair. When we first started dating I quickly found that its just easier to support him and let him do what he wants (almost) and it leaves me to do my thing.

I keep pretty busy and being self employed gives me more time to explore cooking! :-) I'm mostly interested in cook books featuring regular old home cooking and favorites. When I moved to the UK I had to get rid of my cookbook collection. I did keep all my Bermudian cookbooks, charity cookbooks and 'The Foods of Israel Today' and Better Homes and Gardens 'Hometown Favorites'. I am most passionate when it comes to my family and caring for them. Getting to feed them is an added bonus! Lucky for me, my boys are steadily growing pigs with bottomless pits for stomachs! lol :-)",Contributor,4.5,,2004-06-01,8,71,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/taco.png,2619

We like to eat wholesome, nutritious foods free of pesticides and preservatives; therefore, we try to purchase only organic foods. I love to cook and am discovering new ways to prepare fish and vegetables. My ancestors came from Scotland, England, and Germany and I am very much interested in learning about past and current culture and food preparations there as well. Lately, I have been developing a taste for more Indian and Asian cuisines and have enjoyed experimenting in my kitchen! I love to collect cookbooks from a variety of cuisines and have one that catered to the rationing needs of WWII. I like old movies, enjoy shopping for antiques, and love many things vintage. FAVORITE FOODS: I enjoy cooking comfort foods, pot roast and brisket, curries, and love a roast chicken. We like to go out for Asian, Italian, Indian, and Seafood. My cookbooks are a compilation of a few of my own recipes as well as those of Zaar members' whose recipes I've tried and loved or are on my ""can't wait to try"" list. MY RATING SYSTEM: If the dish is outstanding, I will rate it a 5. If I really like it and hope to make it again, I will rate it a 4. If the dish was just ""ok"" and I might make it again w/ adjustments, I'll rate it a 3. I will give it a 2 if it was fair and I probably won't make it again. I will give a recipe a 1 if I just didn't like it or it didn't work out. I will try to give a fair explanation of why I give a low rating. Please don't be offended as my low ratings will not be personal, but rather a true reflection of my experience w/ the recipe. Not everyone likes the same things and our tastes can be different, so please bear that in mind as well.",Contributor,4.7,,2004-11-01,1,9,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pasta.png,69

I'VE ARRANGED THEM SO THAT COOKBOOK SERIES OR SIMPLY COOKBOOKS ON RELATED TOPICS APPEAR TOGETHER, WHICH SHOULD MAKE IT EASIER TO FIND THE ONES THAT INTEREST YOU.] In 2004, I moved home to New England after many years living in the South. Often I go walking in the morning with my sister, who lives near me on the Maine coast--we truly live in a beautiful place. I share a love of ACC basketball with my brother in upstate New York. Nowadays, I rely heavily on Kitty Rosati's Heal Your Heart book (lots of low-sodium recipes) and Donald Gazzaniga's No-Salt, Lowest-Sodium Cookbook. Other cookbooks I frequently use are Weil & Daley's The Healthy Kitchen and Cooking Light's Five-Star Recipes cookbook. From January 2005 to September 2008, I hosted the recipe tagging game ONE-TWO-THREE HIT WONDERS, taking four months off in late 2007, during which the tireless, compassionate and totally wonderful Game Forum Hosts ~Nimz~, justcallmetoni, Lauralie41 and Andi of Longmeadow Farm with incredible kindness of took over my workload. I loved hosting the game and the players there were and are the best, but competing obligations required me to give it up and it's now ably presided over by HokiesLady. In 2008 my dear sister finally joined Recipezaar. Her chef name is Sagadahoc (the county in Maine she lives in). My popular Recipe #89132 is actually her recipe--check it out sometime, it's great! She eventually realized how useful having several cookbooks can be, so I gave her a premium membership as her birthday present in March 2008. Some of my favorite sources of recipes are the public cookbooks of other Zaar chefs. I have over 100 bookmarked to refer to occasionally, but some of my favorites are from the following: In January-February 2007, the Chefs of 1-2-3 Hit Wonders hosted a Cook-a-Thon for veteran Zaar member Sharon123 while she was undergoing chemotherapy at Duke University. The entire group of recipes tagged, cooked and reviewed for the Cook-a-Thon are contained in: Sharon123's Cook-a-Thon Cookbook ~Rita~: Thanks to her stunning photographs, she has one of the most beautiful cookbook lists at Zaar. Her cookbooks focus on a variety of inspired topics, many of them health-related, and the introductions often provide an encyclopedic disquisition on the topic at hand. Some stand-outs: Edible Flowers Honey Honey You`ve got me wanting you! Recipes I named after zaar chefs Menopause If you've been around Zaar any length of time, you probably know that Bergy writes wonderfully detailed and helpful recipe reviews and has also contributed a wealth of wonderful recipes of her own. Judging from comments in the forums, her burger cookbook is the most popular and referenced cookbook at Zaar, and her appetizers cookbook is a treasury of finger foods as well as a major hunting ground for Dim Sum: Saturday Night Burgers Appetizers/Finger Foods PaulaG's own recipes are a well I go back to again and again--I've made tons of her dishes, with great results. Cookbooks of hers I find especially handy include: Chicken Recipes Then There Were 2 As I mentioned above, while I love the cuisines of all regions of the world, my favorite is Greek, and the following from Cookiegirlandi is chockful of great Greek recipes: It's All Greek (Another great way to find Greek recipes is to go cirectly to evelyn/athens' recipe list and then sift for Cuisine-->European__>Southern-->Greek. She currently has 142.) UPDATE: evelyn/athens, host of the Greek Cooking Forum and Greek food expert extraordinaire has a cookbook of her own Greek fecipes that could be the only reference you'll ever need for Greek cuisine: Greek Cookery I'm not a vegetarian, but I do eat meatless meals a fair amount of the time. I've observed that Sharon123 is a great one for cooking fare that's healthy and tastes great, which is why I trust and turn to her: Yummy Vegetarian Dishes If I want to cook something to eat with my friends, the go-to person is Miss Annie: Recipes for Entertaining Pot Luck /Picnic Recipes Dancer^ is single-handedly responsible for tons of great salad dressing and seasoning mixes posted at Zaar. See the evidence in her cookbooks: Dressings & Vinaigrettes Spice and Herb Mixes If I'm hanging out in heaven a hundred years from now, I'm hoping to find they've had the good sense to make NcMysteryShopper and Bev the twin bartenders there, so after I go to my final reward I can continue to imbibe offerings from Cheryl's Book #99544, Book #148198, Book #90314, Book #73634, Book #75595, Book #74074 and Book #70836 cookbooks and Bev's Book #86058 and Book #124180 cookbooks. These ladies know how to set 'em up and I know how to chug 'em! Julesong was one of the first to take advantage of the multiple-cookbook option of premium membership in a big way. For awhile she held the record for most cookbooks at Zaar. Some of those I've particularly liked include: Junior League Cookbook Recipes Second Chance - a generous list of Zaar recipes that received a low-to-mediocre rating but may deserve a second look Newspaper Recipes - some of my own favorites have come from newspapers, including the original version of my most popular recipe Recipe #88939.

When I see in my Zaar InBox one of her thoughtful notes just sent out of the blue to offer an encouraging word, it makes my day. She has a goodly collection of cookbooks, but her true achievement is the 3,000+ recipes she's posted--how does she manage to be so prolific yet keep the quality of her offerings so high?

I own more gardening and craft books than cook books, that's what drew me to recipezaar. My passions are cooking, gardening, scrapbooking, sewing and spending time with my family. My biggest problem right now is finding time to spend on this wonderful site. Last summer I did start back up canning and I even purchased a pressure canner so now I'm canning a little more than just jams and jellies.

I live in Black Forest, just north of Colorado Springs with my husband, Jim (an engineer) and Ripley (Bichon Frisee) and Bogey (miniature Aussie). We love it here--we see lots of deer, sometimes a bear, cayotes, foxes, racoons, and squirrels. We have a huge pond on the property. The mallards are here now and they have babies every year. I was a buyer of electronics for the aircraft and medical industries for 26 years. I guess I'm semi-retired; I work occasionally when something comes up. My last job was in a bank. When that branch closed I quit and have been looking for something to do since then, either a job or volunteer work. Our daughter is grown and we have two grandkids, one girl and one boy. They call me Grammy Donna. I love to paint (watercolors), read, cook, scuba dive, garden and travel. Our favorite scuba destination is Cozumel and we go whenever we can. I would love to dive the Great Barrier Reef someday. My husband loves my cooking and always asks that I cook enough for leftovers for lunch. Once at a work gathering one of his co-workers came up to me and said ""Jim's lunches are the envy of everybody here"". My mother would never let me cook, so the minute I moved away cooking became my passion. As a teen I copied recipes out of her magazines, saving them for when I was on my own. I love planning menus for the week and try to make our meals interesting and varied. Living at an altitude of 7,500 feet makes baking difficult, even using the high altitude adjustments. Also, I love to garden, but the growing season is only three months if we're lucky. I have seen it snow after Memorial Day here. My pet peeve is people who think they are better than eveyone else and people that tailgate me when driving. Also, people who start out their reviews ""I'm not going to rate this because bla bla bla. They don't seem to know that by not rating they are giving the recipe 0 stars, thus lowering the total rating of the recipe. Also reviews that state that they made a recipe but added this and changed that and say that ""this way it's better"" Why don't they just post their own recipe? I do not give bad ratings. This is supposed to be a friendly community and there is no reason to hurt someone's feelings. This is not Iron Chef or Hell's Kitchen. I have been cooking long enough to tell by reading a recipe whether we'll like it or not.",Contributor,4.8,United States,2004-01-01,0,0,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/burger.png,2310

They had 7 children; Bruce, Francis, Howard, Charlie, Mignon, Joe and Sarah. Food and cooking was a big part of Charlie and Mary's lives and has been a big part of their childrens lives as well. Francis's Poem The Hill Clan even talks about it. The Hill Clan When we were growing up, there was plenty, Seven kids to feed, that was too many. Dad, I remember you always worked hard. And when it came to gambling, you were a card. Mom, you were always in the kitchen, Cooking, baking and making decisions. What to do with one pound of hamburger, to feed seven, And you always did, Oh thank heaven!!! Bruce and I were always elected to do the dishes, And we always did, with Dad's best wishes. Howard and Charlie were on the run, The rest of us prayed they would never get a gun. Mom, Mignon always hung in there by your knee, You couldn't even take time to pee. Then, there was Joe, we couldn't figure where he came from, The baker, the milkman, or some bum. Sarah Ann, we thought she was the best, She turned out to be the biggest mess. This little ditty was just for fun, For the rest of my life I will be on the run. This picture was taken at Mary and Charlie's 50th Wedding Anniversary in 1988. Mary wrote this poem for that occasion and read it before the cake was cut. Fifty Year Anniversary Fifty years of marriage is something to behold, Especially if all your friends are one hundred percent all gold. And to come from a very large family that came many miles, To wish us both the best of luck, with a kiss, a hug, and a smile. We wonder how we can be so lucky to have all our children, grandchildren and great grandchildren here, We hold them all so very dear. It has been a wonderful anniversary, And I must confess that we love you all and thank you all, And close with just a heartfelt God Bless. These recipes are from not only from Mary and Charlie, but their 7 children, their spouses, their children and spouses. Thrown in are also recipes from Mary's sister and niece. The Hill clan produced lots of good cooks and even more good eaters. Mary also wrote this poem about her 50 years of marriage and boy was she right about more grandchildren and greatgrandchildren to come. 50 Years It has been 50 years since I was caught. Charlie chased me down and we tied the knot. With a family of seven, it took alot of living. But more then that, lots of forgiving. We had four boys and three girls, And I'm happy to say, they are still with us up to this day. Nineteen grandchildren and five great, I am sure there will be more, after this date. We done our part for posterity, I think that's the way it's supposed to be. There will always be room for more. We have hung a welcome sign on our door.

Since I started working from home four years ago, it really has assisted in my flexibility to prepare a healthy, delicious dinner every night. I feel like I still have alot I can learn, especially when it comes to baking. I was married in September, 2006 to my best friend, Estevan. My husband and I share a love of cooking together. I really enjoy planning out the week and deciding what we will try next, and it takes the panic out of what's for dinner? I also try to do OAMC (once a month cooking) method when I can. I love the food netork, and I really love Rachel Ray and her cookbooks. I have recently been cooking alot out of her big orange book. It is my newest favorite. I am abit of a cookbook collector, and recently purchased a larger bookcase to store all of them in my kitchen. However, I tend to rely on recipezaar first now when I am looking for something in particular. I love this site and it's community of users! In my free time, I enjoy scrapbooking and would love to devote more time to it as a hobby. It is a great creative release for me. Estevan and I love to travel as much as we can as well. We were blessed with our first son 2 years ago (Grayson), and are enjoying being parents. We also have 3 furry kids, Bailey, (german shepard/ blue heeler) and 2 bichons - Bella and Jack.

Paul says that every night is a culinary adventure since then (at least I don't have to worry that my cooking is boring him). I've always enjoyed cooking. My (very Italian) mother taught me to cook from scratch. Jarred pasta sauce was the greatest sin in her eyes.

I reserve the right to bump up or down a half star a recipe based on the actual recipe and how easy it was, etc. etc. I have to admit, it's been a couple of years since I updated this text and in the meantime, my picky picky DD has flowered into a girl who enjoys California rolls, will give almost everything a try, and in general much less picky than the average 7 year old in this area.

I'm also an avid reader, but I have difficulty finding the time. I love to travel. Since moving to Europe I've been lucky enough to have had the opportunity to go a couple of times per year to Paris, as well as having visited London, Rome, Florence, Naples, Amsterdam, and of course Brussels and Antwerp. I've seen at least parts of most regions of France, as well as parts of Germany, Austria, a great deal of Switzerland, Slovenia, Croatia, Luxembourg, and Monaco. I'm absolutely in love with the Bay of Naples and Sorrento coast areas of Italy, which my husband and I recently re-visited on a trip that included Rome, Puglia, Umbria and Marche. I'm still looking forward to Ireland, Spain, Portugal, the Czech Republic . . . the list is too long ! One of the bonuses of travel is getting to taste the local cuisine, and afterward trying to figure out how to duplicate it at home. I think cooking is one of the nicest things a person can do for someone they love (including themself!) I had to submit a picture with me and my cat, Sophie, as she insists on sitting in my lap when I'm sitting at the computer. If you are wondering what all that stuff hanging on the wall behind us in the photo is, it is just a small part of my husband's military medal collection.

89820,87023,https://www.food.com/user/87023,Latchy,"Our dear friend Latchy passed away from acute myeloid leukemia in August 2006, after being diagnosed with the disease in October 2005. She was a dear friend to many Recipezaar members throughout the world and she will be greatly missed. Latchy was a great chef; and her speciality was Asian food. She loved wine and cheese, but wasn’t fussed on desserts. She had a great sense of humour and was the life of any party. Latchy was her childhood nickname, and those of us who knew her real name still called her ‘Latch’. We loved her. With the permission of Latchy’s daughter, here is the eulogy read at her funeral (edited slightly to maintain the family’s privacy). Recipezaar and her Recipezaar chat group, the ‘Tipsy Tarts’ were represented at the funeral by Latchy’s close Zaar friends, Mummamills, Chrissyo and Liara: “Latchy, was born in Melbourne in 1939. In her younger years she led a very energetic life and was very involved in swimming and dancing. She had the opportunity to compete in the 1956 Olympics but couldn’t be fussed to do the training and preferred to enjoy herself instead. Latchy met her late husband, Bruce, in Melbourne. Bruce being with the army, they started their life of travel together and extended their family. Their first child was born in Perth, their second in New Guinea and their third child, in Melbourne. They also lived in Newcastle, Sydney, and Singapore before settling in Brisbane. It was in Singapore that her love of cooking, sewing and craft began. Latchy broke military protocol for dining-in nights. Women were finally allowed to attend. One day, Bruce was watching a TV program about sailing around the world. On the program when the wife was told of this plan she said “No Way”, but Latchy said, “When are you going to start?” So, Bruce retired from the army to begin building a 54 foot steel ketch in the back yard, learning as he went. Latchy worked for many years until they finally set off around the world in 1987. They got as far as Malaysia and loved it so much they didn’t go any further. They loved the lifestyle, the people and the food and only came back when Bruce fell ill. After Bruce passed away, Latchy developed her talents, such as painting, and became involved with her family and grandchildren. About 7 years ago, she decided to make her life in Hervey Bay, a beach-side retirement town in Queensland, Australia. She loved the lifestyle, the people and became very involved in the community life. Latchy started volunteering with tax help, then the multicultural respite where she put her cooking skills to use and then with Legacy (an organization which supports the widows of servicemen and ex-servicemen). Latchy opened up a new world by learning about computers and the internet and she met her great friends, the Tipsy Tarts through the website Recipezaar. Latchy was a strong, independent, funny, straight forward and loving mother, grandmother and friend, and we will miss her greatly.”",Contributor,4.6,"Torquay, Queensland - Australia",2003-05-01,0,13,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/taco.png,2852
89827,243474,https://www.food.com/user/243474,Little_Sister,"I grew up in Shreveport, Louisiana and now live in the Dallas area. I learned a lot about cooking from my Granny who was an excellent down home cook. She was one of those that could cook most anything from memory. Very seldom did she use a recipe or use measuring cups unless it was for baking. She used the pinch of this, a dash of that method.Wish I would have paid more attention back in the day but luckily my sister remembers most of the things I don't. I, on the other hand, most always have to have a recipe in front of me no matter how many times I've made something. I have a ton of cookbooks that are now a little dusty since I came across Recipezaar a few years ago. There is one thing here with the reviewers that bothers me a bit. They will completely change ingredients or cooking method and then leave a negative review. I usually try to follow a recipe as closely as possible although sometimes I will change it due to ingredients on hand or to personal preference but if I make the slightest alteration and don't like it, I just wont leave a review. I love my family, friends and all animals. Especially my 10 year old yorkie Munchkin, my 5 year old silky terrier Rowdy and our outside pets, the geckos. I have the best husband a girl could ever hope for and I'm blessed in so many ways.

89899,1329782,https://www.food.com/user/1329782,SarasotaCook,"Growing up in Michigan, I spent my summers at my cottage in the Northern part up by Traverscity. On a lake, big garden which had all the vegetables you could imagine. My mom taught school, so summers were our vacation time. Gramps and I fished all the time so fresh fish was always on the menu, perch, blue gill, walleye and small and large mouth bass. At age 5 I learned how to clean my own fish and by 10 I was making dinner, canning vegetables and fruits, making pies and fresh breads. Apples fresh picked every fall, strawberries in June and July, Cherries at the Cherry Festival in Traverscity. So fresh foods always were a big part. Mom worked as a teacher during the year so dinner was more traditional with pot roasts, meatloaf, etc, but it seemed we always had fresh fruits and vegetables as part of the meal. Mom also didn't use as many spices as I do, but times were different back then. So ... My motto is ... There is NO Right and NO Wrong with cooking. So many people thing they have to follow a recipe. But NO ... a recipe is a method and directions to help and teach someone. Cooking is about personal tastes and flavors. I love garlic ... and another person may not. I like heat ... but you may not. Recipes are building blocks, NOT text ground in stone. Use them to make and build on. Even my recipes I don't follow most times --They are a base. That is what cooking is to me. A base of layer upon layer of flavors. I still dislike using canned soups or packaged gravies/seasoning ... but I admit, I do use them. I have a few recipes that use them. But I try to strive to teach people to use fresh ingredients, they are first ... so much healthier for you ... and second, in the end less expensive. But we all have our moments including me. So, lets see ... In the past, I have worked as a hostess, bartender, waitress, then a short order cook, salad girl in the kitchen, sort of assistant chef, head chef, co owner of a restaurant ... now a consultant to a catering company/restaurant, I cater myself and I'm a personal chef for a elderly lady. I work doing data entry during the day, and now and then try to have fun which is not very often due to my job(s). I have a 21 year old who at times is going on 12, aren't they all. Was married and now single and just trying to enjoy life one day at a time. I'm writing a cookbook ... name is still in the works but it is dedicated to those people who never learned, to cook. Single Moms, Dads, or Just Busy Parents. Those individuals that think you can't make a great dinner for not a lot of money. You can entertain on a budget and I want people to know that gourmet tasting food doesn't have to be from a can of soup or a box, and healthy food doesn't come from a drive through. There are some really good meals that people can make which are healthy and will save money but taste amazing. So I guess that is my current goal. We all take short cuts and I have no problem with that - I do it too. I volunteer and make food for the homeless every couple of months, donating my time and money. I usually make soup for them and many times get donations from a local grocery stores, Sams Club, Walmart etc, with broth, and vegetables. It makes my cost very little and well worth every minute I spend.

To me a cook is someone who can come up with their own recipes and have success at it (like my daughter).",Contributor,4.7,,2006-11-01,1,3,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/fruit-kebab.png,4057

It's got to smell good. Now, I admit that sometimes something might look horrible, yet it tastes fantastic. But not the other way around, if it doesn't taste good, I don't care how good it looks. Yuk. I love to cook too. I used to really love to cook, then I had kids, and went throught the ""we have to eat better"" phase (or as my husband likes to call it 'grazing' phase) and pretty much ended up hating to cook. Why cook when nobody liked it anyway? Then I got smart and started trying to cook healthier s-l-o-w-l-y. So now we eat a bit better, and I'm starting to love to cook again. I'm leaning more toward a Mediterranean Diet now. I adore olives, so that works. haha I also love to travel, good thing, because I own a travel agency. I'm a Hawai'I specialist, I live to go to Hawai'I as often as possible. I'm married almost 20 years, and have three kids. Two grown girls and a young son. They are my life, well part of it anyway.

To a Wildwood 26' bunk travel trailer that we ADORE! My family loves rv'ing, we normally camp up north. Stowe Vermont is so far one of our favorite places to go, however New Hampshire, Maine, Massachusetts are right on the list too! I love to cook, but baking is my favorite. I take after my grandmother who is a 100% Italian and always cooks for an army. Because you never know if someone may show up around dinner time and heaven to Betsy if you didn't have enough to share!!! Also like my grandmother, I love having parties. So far our house is the place to be, from weekend BBQ's to Holidays. We make sure that we have enough food and always something new to do (games etc). I'm married to the most wonderful man in RI, whom I've known pretty much all my life. I wouldn't trade him in for the world! I also have two great kids, 15 year old daughter who is smart creative and always helpful, and an 11 year old son who is my smart, lovable comedian! Last but not least our dog Bailey. He's an Australian Shepard/Black Lab, who doesn't realize he's THAT big. Who is happy to have company come over and give him a pet. Bailey has been diagnosed with epilepsy. We hate seeing him have a seizure it breaks our heart! I started collecting cookbooks, but by far this website is MUCH better than any cookbook. First of all it gets reviews and comments can't find that in cookbooks. Secondly there are SOOO many recipes to choose from! The hubby and kids are the guinea pigs for all the recipes that I find here. So far I've been making a binder of all the recipes I've tried, tweaked with and rated so it's right at my disposal. My daughter is following in my footsteps and always looking to offer an extra hand in cooking or baking. And she also enjoys trying new things, by far the easiest one to feed in the house! My second passion is to read. I love to curl into my overstuffed chair, a log burning in the fireplace, sipping a cup of coffee and reading a good mystery/thriller novel. Once I get engrossed in it, forget about it, the whole day just passes by without me noticing.

Comfort food during the long cold winters and clambakes items for the summer. I work as a function manager and am getting ideas from the chef who works here.

I have been able to find an awesome red sauce recipe from scratch sent to me via recipezaar member and fellow Red Soxs Fan! I learned how to cook out of pure self defense. As much as I love my mother, she can't cook. Unfortuantely my younger sister has obtained my mother's cooking skills. My father's mother who lived with us growing up couldn't cook either. She could bake. THAT she was good at. My mother would microwave EVERYTHING, including roast beef. Even to this day, Roast beef in the microwave for 15 minutes and its done. Its not exactly tasty. My grandmother would boil everything to the point of non-chewable. I refuse to use the microwave unless it is reheating something. The foodnetwork channel is my all time favorite channel. I love Paula Deen and Tyler Florence, although I wish his new show would stop making me dizzy with the camera shots moving so quickly around the set.

90567,89549,https://www.food.com/user/89549,nott2339,"Hi! My name is Nancy and I live in northern Virginia, about 28 miles south of Washington, D.C. I am a photo editor at a famous magazine publisher whose mission it is to ""increase and diffuse Geographic knowledge."" No, I don't get to travel. It's just a job, like most others out there. 9-5 and draining! Not nearly as glamorous as many imagine. My true passions are marine biology, nature in general, and cooking. I have been cooking since I was old enough to help out Mom in the kitchen. I have always been adventurous in eating, and am willing to try anything at least once. I am always searching out new flavors, ingredients, and techniques. I love shopping in all the ethnic grocery stores that abound in this area... Vietnamese, Pakistani, Indian, Afghan, Hispanic of all sorts, Korean, Russian, German. I would love to be able to open a small gourmet food store or deli in a beach-side town. Oh my, my paradise and dream. Cook in the morning, then enjoy the beach in the evening. It would be hard to name a favorite cookbook. I owned over 500 at one time, and have since whittled down my collection. A cookbook was always my favorite souvenir from any travels I took. Hmmmm, I guess I would have to say my favorites are the Marlboro cookbooks. Yes, put out by the Marlboro cigarette company. No, I do not smoke, but these cookbooks are beautiful to look at, and the recipes are to die for. They consist of good old American foods, grilling, and just good times for all. These 3 books are my food porn! ;-) I enjoy Nigella Lawson's cookbooks, too. She has style, flair, and a wonderful sense of humor. If I had to pick a famous foodie to dine with it would be her. Hey, and where has Andrew Zimmern been all my life!?!

90623,62264,https://www.food.com/user/62264,Busters friend,"First about Buster: Buster moved onto whatever comes next on February 26, 2008. He was just shy of five years old. I miss him terribly. He came into our lives when he ran out in front of my car late one night as I was driving home. A just under 4 pound ball of kitten fluff, complete with an ostrich boa tail that stayed straight up as he assessed his new domain. He became a 19 pound longhaired beast who guarded our house (he followed any new guests or servicepeople the entire time they are on the property) & even killed copperheads (among other things with his hunting buddy, Fergus the short-tailed)! Friends never saw his formidible side as he smiled at them & uttered the most incongruent kitten-like mews as he threaded legs! He liked to ride in the car & came to the beach. There are Buster-approved recipes in my offerings - however, HE decided which he wanted to consider - Buster demonstrated he liked pumpkin anything - ALOT -LOL!!! Copperhead count 2006 - Buster 2 (10 inchers w/yellow tails) 2007 - Buster & Roxie 1 (a 24 incher!) Buster woken from beauty sleep - http://www.recipezaar.com/members/home/62264/DSCN0335.JPG Big whiskers - http://www.recipezaar.com/members/home/62264/DSCN0333.JPG For those of you who gave kind condolences - thank you so very much. http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=250301 I love to cook & incorporate techniques from Southern/Mid Atlantic roots (grits, eastern NC BBQ shoulders, Brunswick stew, steamed crabs & shrimp & shellfish, hushpuppies, cornbread, greens, shad roe, scrapple) with Pacific Rim foods & techniques aquired while living in Pacific Northwest, fish & game recipes learned while living in Rocky Mountain region & foods/techniques learned travelling to the Big Island & up into BC & Alberta & into the Caribbean. The Middle Eastern/African likes I have are remnants of my parents who lived for many years in North Africa & Mediterranean before I was thought of. Makes for wide open cooking! Since moving back east we try to go annually in the deep winter to Montreal (Old Montreal auberges & La Reine) & Quebec City (Winter Carnival & Chateau Frontenac)- for unctuous foie gras & real cheeses, French & Canadian meals prepared & served exquisitely, fantastic music & wonderful people - with the cold helping burn off some of the calories! I love putting in our aluminum jonboat & heading across the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW) to the barrier islands for foraging & exploring! Bodysurfing is a lifelong sport for me - one that a person's body never seems to forget how to do, once the knack is learned (thank goodness!) I especially miss cool summers & foggy/drizzly days & fall mushroom foraging/anytime of year hot springing in WA, OR, MT, ID, BC & Alberta.",Contributor,4.4,"Pleasure Island, 73",2002-11-01,23,25,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/burger.png,999

The outpouring of support from the Recipezaar community while his health was declining was a huge comfort to him and even ""perked him up"" a bit in his final month. Miller was a huge asset to Recipezaar, not only due to his incredible collection of recipes, but his participation in the forums. Miller was known for his wonderful low-sodium recipes, his warmth, and last, but not least, his wicked, dry sense of humor. Liza at Recipezaar ********************************************************* No, the picture to the left is not me. It is, in fact, a picture of famous TV Chef Jamie Oliver (a/k/a Thpit Boy)’s grandfather, the late Sir Topaz McWhacker. Note the strong family resemblance, most noticeable in the nose, eyebrows, and general lack of cleanliness Legend has it that Topaz taught Thpit everything that he knows about whacking and about only washing and combing his hair twice a year. . Instead of the trivia that many Recipezaar members have displayed on their “About Me” pages, I thought it might be a tad more helpful if I were to provide some beneficial information that you can put to good practical use either in your own kitchen or when you are watching the antics of some celebrated TV chefs. So, for your enlightenment..... . . Chairman Kaga: When he says “Ion Shff”, he really means “Iron Chef” or, perhaps, “I need a Kleenex” . Chef Paula Deen: When she says “awl”, she really means “oil”. When she says “y’all”, she really means “everyone except m’all”. When she says “bring the water to a bawl”, I have no clue what she means - I thought you could only make a baby “bawl”. And, boys and girls, you can easily Deenize the sentences that you use in your very own kitchen, such as “All y’all can bawl your corn in olive awl or wrap it in aluminum fawl”. . Emeril Lagasse: When he says “confectionery sugar’, he really means “confectioners’ sugar”. When he says “pappa-reeka”, he really means “paprika”. When he says “inside of”, he really means “in”. When he says “a little”, he really means “a lot”. Have you ever tried to count the number of times he says “a little” during any given show? Don’t – it will drive you nuts. When he says “cardamin”, he really means “cardamom”. When he says “my water don’t come seasoned”, what he really means is “I need a new joke writer”. When he says “that www dot food thing”, he really means “I flunked Computerese 101”. . Iron Chef Morimoto: When he says “Foo Netwu”, he really means “Food Network”. . Dessert Dude Jacques Torres: When he says “I going”, he really means “I am going”. (The verb “to be” has apparently been deleted from the French language.) . Spit Boy Jamie Oliver: When he says “whack it in the oven”, he really means “I am into hot, kinky stuff”. When he says “Bob’s yer uncle”, what he really means is “you’d better ask your aunt how well she REALLY knew that mailman named Robert”. When he says “rocket”, he really means “an older weapon being used in Iraq”. When he says “Fewd Netwuk”, he really means “Food Network”. . Numerous chefs: When they say “codfish” and “tunafish”, what they really mean is “cod” and “tuna”, respectively. Please note that they use these terms so that you don’t go out and buy “codanimal” or “tunavegetable” by mistake. Having said that, I have no clue as to why they don’t refer to “troutfish”, “salmonfish”, “red snapperfish”, etc., etc. . Giggly-Wiggly Rachael Ray: When she says “EVOO”, she really means “don’t use BOCO (boring old corn oil)”. When she says “a little lettuce action going on”, she really means “with only 8 minutes left in the game, cabbages are still in the lead, but lettuces are making a strong comeback”. . Two Fat Ladies: When they say “I gwing”, they really mean “I am going” or “Sorry, but we have been watching too many episodes of Jacques Torres’ show”. . Please note that the above is not all-inclusive. If there are other celebrity chef words or phrases that have you stumped, please post an ""ISO"" message in the discussion forums and I will find the translation for you.",Contributor,4.5,Christmas Island,2001-11-01,0,185,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/sushi.png,2873

Since 1997 I've lived in the beautiful mountains of western NC, where I spend way too much time at work and not nearly enough time camping! I have a partner of 15 years (Lee) and 3 kids--2 grown and 1 teenager still at home. Lee doesn't cook, but she's my cooking cheerleader, and she and my son will always at least try anything I make, no matter what. Camping is one of my favorite things to do. Other favorite ways to spend my time are doing beadwork, knitting, and making homemade soap. I should also admit that I spend waaaay too much time on the internet, but the bright side of that is that it brought me to Zaar! I spend a ridiculous amount of time here, but I love every minute of it. It's also has helped cure me of my pathological cookbook buying. I used to call cookbooks with full-page glossy photos my food porn. ;-) Now, thanks to all the talented photographers here, I can get all the food porn I want! I love to read recipes, which most of my friends think is just weird. I suspect, though, that a lot of you don't think it's weird at all! I love to cook, but only when I want to. I also love to entertain and wish I had time to do more of it. I love trying new recipes. I was a vegetarian (vegan, actually) for several years, and that's when I got hooked on trying so many different cuisines. I still love vegetarian foods, but I do eat some meat, fish, and dairy/eggs now. I still try to keep it healthy and eat as little processed food as possible, but I'm not totally strict about it. Sometimes I want some good old junk food--I just try to make it home-made junk, so at least I know what's in it! My pet peeve is willful ignorance.

I love to hike & take my dogs out for walks. I go out in the 10 person voyageur canoe our Paddling Club acquired this year maybe once or twice a week, with as few as 4 and a maximum of 10 paddlers. We have yet to do a big organized trip, maybe next year when the club's better established. Love to workout at our gym, and instruct cardio step classes as of this year (2008). Life's organized around one hubby, 2 dogs, & 2 cats. Just lost my 13 year old cat who I have as an icon on one of my cookbooks to old age, which has been a sad experience. That's my dog Neige you see as my icon. My culinary influences include Molly Katzen (Moosewood cookbooks), Taste of Home, flipping through magazines, Simmering Suppers (one-pot meals from Harrowsmith Kitchens)and Rose Reisman Brings Home Light Pasta, which was a fundraising project for the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation. Hunting out recipes is my favourite part of food prep. whether it's being on the zaar or having nose in cookbook. I'm not the only recipe lover in the world but I know lots of people cook and bake without directions and create their own beautiful dishes. Some can look at a recipe and decide how to modify it to their own liking. Some never make the same thing twice, some make the same things over and over. I love when I finally have a recipe down pat, down by ""heart"", and I think I'm a pretty good cook; I have a style that infuses my cooking even though I can't back off far enough to get a real sense of that style, and I think love and wisdom and calmness and other good qualities permeate my dishes. Maybe a love for adventure, the unknown, flavours the food I prepare, since that's reflected in my choice to try new recipes all the time. A love for people may come through reflecting my interest in who the author is of the recipe I'm using. I like knowing something about them, even if it's just where they're from which is usually pretty accessible information either from the cookbook or the Zaar or magazines. My love for home, homelife, my devotion to the ones I love, the ones I cook and bake for, surely that's an essential ingredient in my dishes.",Contributor,4.5,Canada,2002-12-01,19,11,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/drink.png,1269

I enjoy cooking, cross stitching, and LOVE NFL Football - GO BUCS - GO PATS! UPDATE: 2/8/2008 My friend Bruce introduced me to Recipezaar. We used to play a game called Randomization where he would hit the randon recipe button, and whatever came up - I would have to make. For some of you who have read my reviews, this may make more sense to you now. Bruce refused to let me use his name - he preferred to remain anonymous so I used the name Herkimer for him instead, much to his chagrin. Shockingly, Bruce died Aug 28, 2007. He was the light of my life. I haven't cooked in a while - certainly nothing like I did when we would play. I can't believe he's gone - I miss him so much. Things just really aren't the same. The last randomization recipe that I completed was Oranges in Caramel Syrup Recipe #175594 - I delivered them to him on the Friday morning before he died on Tuesday night. Saturday mornings we would play the game, if I had completed the recipe from the previous randomization. The last Saturday we played I received Chick Pea and Tomato Curry Recipe #274313. I never made it. He knew I was sick of the idea of having to eat Chick Peas because I don't like them. He was so pleased with himself - his mantra for the game was He couldn't be happy until I was unhappy because he knew I was such a picky eater - anything Green or a Vegetable was a challenge. Let me assure you that after all the moaning and groaning I did over that recipe - he must have died a very happy man.

When I closed my eyes, it almost felt like back home, when we used to sit in the outside garden of the ""Rialto"", an italian ice cream cafe, watching the city go about it's bussy day. > I wish they'd sell it in a larger size: MEMORY IN A GALLON! But then, thinking of it, that might not be a good idea...",Contributor,,,2007-05-01,2,1,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/fruit-kebab.png,5686

Consequently, I spend more time collecting new recipes than actually cooking them. I probably have 3000 recipes sorted into my private cookbooks here on Recipezaar. I figured that my house could only hold so many cookbooks but not so when I collect recipes online. :) Speaking of books, I'm a voracious reader and I probably buy at least 10 books a week by swapping books on http://paperbackswap.com, http://bookmooch.com and http://titletrader.com. My husband, Mike, likes to build furniture and he regularly has to build me more bookshelves. :) I'm self employed as a Real Estate Agent. Nothing beats being your own boss! I used to be a missionary in Ethiopia and Haiti were I started and managed several orphanages and international adoption programs. I also created and did the computer programming for the Precious in HIS Sight Adoption photolisting at http://precious.org but sold it in 2005. I live in College Station, Texas. I'm originally from Houston, Texas and I'm one of the rare people who enjoys moving. We seem to move about every 4 years because of my husband's job (he works for Trane air conditioning). I'm very involved at my church mentoring inner city kids. I believe that the purpose of life is to glorify God and I do that by helping others and evangelism. My favorite Christian TV program is The Way of the Master with Kirk Cameron and Ray Comfort. Their website is at http://wayofthemaster.com. I love to travel and since my husband travels 2/3 of the time with his engineering job, our agreement is that I get to use his frequent flyer miles. We host foreign exchange students each year so my next trip will hopefully be to visit one of our former students in Korea. I love making new friends so drop me an email and say hi!

91700,386849,https://www.food.com/user/386849,Munchkin Mama,"Hi! I'm so glad you've made it over to my little corner of RecipeZaar. I just love this site- I find it very theraputic and fun to surf for new recipes. My favorite ones are quick and easy and yet use a minimum of convenience items. Oh, and they have to taste yummy enough to serve my hungry munchkins!! I have two great little ones, a boy and a girl, which I affectionately refer to as ""the smalls"". I stay at home with them every day while my wonderfully loving and perfect-for-me husband works hard for us. Besides loving to cook, I also love to sew (simple projects- a seamstress I am not) and crochet. No afghans or doilies here, just cute little dolls and sometimes baby slippers or hats. I like to make quick things- they give the instant gratification I need!! I love to cook and I really love Recipezaar! I am glad to have met so many nice people through this site. I have a couple of family members that also love RecipeZaar: my sister cass and sam http://www.recipezaar.com/member/663171 and my mom is pondfrogs http://www.recipezaar.com/member/148840. Together we scour these pages for the best and yummiest RecipeZaar has to offer. Here's how I rate recipes I've tried. 1. I do not like to give one or two stars, and I especially dont like to give them unless I know I followed the recipe correctly. 1. I would consider any rating that I give 3 stars or better to be a ""good"" recipe. 2. Any recipe that I give a ""4"" my husband and I really enjoyed and I would definitely make again. 3. Any recipe that I give a ""5"" is an exceptional recipe that I wouldnt want to live without. I also consider the time to make and how easy it was to prepare. For example, even if a recipe was ""very good"" (which is 4 stars according to Recipezaar), I might rate it 5 stars because it tasted great, was easy, and didnt take a long time to make. When cooking I try to avoid convenience foods when possible. It seems like people are on either one side of the fence or the other when it comes to this. As for me, I feel like I am cheating when I use canned soup or a pre-made ingredient. It's generally healthier and less expensive, so I try and stick with the real stuff. Lately I am a one-armed cook, with my boy on my hip and my girl swinging away in her infant swing. My little guy loves to help me cook. I pull a chair up to the counter and he is my little assistant. Really he makes more of a mess than anything, but he sure does enjoy himself! I have done a lot of freezer cooking, which I really enjoy and have found to be a real convenience. I am a strong advocate for breastfeeding and have been either breastfeeding, pregnant, or both for the past 3 years. It is so important for little munchkins to get the nutrition that they need! :) We are Christians and try to live according to the principles of the Bible. I want to be my husband's crowning glory and my kids to grow up knowing Jesus Christ and all He has done for us. My hearts desire is to be a genuine person who makes a difference, even if just in my little corner of the world. A few months ago my Mom (her 'zaar name is Pondfrogs) was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 46. My Grandma (her Mom) died at an early age of the same form of breast cancer, and my husbands mom is also a survivor. So, I feel very blessed to be in good health and try to keep in perspective that we are only on this earth for such a short while. That's why It is so important to know Jesus as Savior, because He is the only way to Heaven! Thank you for visiting my little page. I sure hope that you try and enjoy my recipes :). Take comfort in knowing that I wont post one publicly unless I've tried it and consider it Recipezaar-worthy.",Contributor,4.6,,2006-11-01,15,37,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/drink.png,854

As you can tell, we love animals and can't wait to one day add a French Bulldog to the mix! I guess you could say that I am a stay at home mom to our furbabies at the moment. In my early 20's, I worked retail management and then in my late 20's I was a personal trainer. I still love to work out but find it hard to find the time these days since we are starting our own business in real estate. So besides cooking, that takes up a lot of my free time right now. I love to cook ( now that's a shock I know ) playing in my garden, reading ( anything by John Saul, Robin Cook, James Patterson and whatever I can get my hands on at flea markets...) I also like to dabble in aromatherapy and finding natural alternatives to commercial cleaners and body care products. My other passions include spending time with my DH... and college football ( GO GAMECOCKS!!!) and just enjoying each other's company... whether it be here at home or up in the South Carolina mountains where we like to go toget away. Some of my pet peeves are: overly processed foods, people who will not try something new or different... intolerant and ignorant people, and disorder in MY kitchen!!! just to name a few...

Most of my time here alone is spent playing euchre, canning, gardening, cooking (a lot of OAMC), flipping thru my cook books (and i have plenty) and browsing thru Zaar! I just love it here. Trying to add a lot of our family favorites. I enjoy traveling, reading, camping, fishing, hunting, gardening, canning, bbq-ing, bon fires, entertaining, baking, playing board and card games with the kids, swimming, photography, and just being with family and friends. ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~ How I rate: 5 stars ~ perfect, will make again without any changes. 4 stars ~ like it, will make again with minor changes to suit our tastes 3 stars ~ had to make major changes but got it to work for us. 2 stars ~ too many changes needed, waste of my time. 1 star ~ just terrible, couldnt get it to work out. waste of money and time.

I spent a lot of my childhood with my grandma. She was a wonderful baker who went through the depression, I learned so much from her from her experiences. I love making her ""heritage"" recipes, brings my childhood back for my children and my brothers who enjoyed the treats. Her Blueberry muffin recipe is one of my absolute favorite. When I was still at home I was put in charge of meals at harvest time from the time I was old enough to use the stove. I loved coming home from school to make a big meal to haul out the field. All my friends when home to sit in front of the tv and I stood at the stove. I grew up in the local 4-H club, spent 10 years as a member. I am still a huge supporter of our club and very proud of its history. My mom and I organized a 50th Anniversay cookbook in 1997. It is probably my most used paper cookbook...zaar being my most used online of course. I love to can. I started with Aunt Lori's salsa a few years ago. I have expanded to jams, jellies, pickles,..whatever catches my eye at the time. I am a berry picker and love that fresh fruit to make the homemade jams and jellies. Being raised in Sask we have the opportunity to pick a variety of wild berries...Saskatoons, pincherries, chokecherries, strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, thorn apples, gooseberries,currents...we have picked them all. I will rarely post anything less than a 4 star review and most of the time just won't post a review until I have tried the recipe a second time. It could be my error. I don't count the dayhome kids opinion in my ratings because they like something one day and hate it the next",Contributor,4.7,Canada,2005-02-01,2,7,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/sushi.png,1574

I love the fact that real people review these recipes and add their own hints and tips. My son has recently (Sept 8, 2003)started the ketogenic diet for his epilepsy so I'm learning how to disguise cream and oil and how to make miniscule portions look bigger. It's an interesting challenge. As of Februaury 27, 2004 there has been no improvement in my son's seizures so we have have decided to stop the diet. We have to stop the diet gradually though so it will be about two months before he can eat regular food again. There is one more medication we can try and after that our last option is a VNS (vagal nerve stimulator). It is similar to a pacemaker but for the vagal nerve in your neck instead of for the heart. Wish us luck! Update Feb 2005- Well, my son had the vns implanted in June 2004 and it hasn't stopped the seizures but it did make them shorter (30-45 seconds instead of 2 to 2 1/2 minutes).

A recipe is merely words on paper; a guideline, a starting point from which to improvise. It cannot pretend to replace the practiced hand and telling glance of a watchful cook. For that reason feel free to stir your own ideas into any dish. When you cook it once, it becomes yours, so personalize it a bit. Add more of an ingredient you like or less of something you don?t like. Try substituting one ingredient for another. Remember words have no flavour, you have to add your own! My need to experiment and want to cook tasty meals came to me after being diagnosed Celiac in December of 1999. What would I have done without the Zaar?

I look forward to working on it every week. I've made several pages on my site that link to many Zaar recipes--like my Cupcakes page, and my Christmas Gift Ideas, and Recipes for Romantic Dates at Home. :) Lately, I've been enjoying ""The Sneaky Chef"" with my kids.

I have liked cooking since I was a little girl, strangely enough, my mother never really enjoyed cooking, so I don't know where I am getting it from. Cooking is really taking a break for me (at least of my two boys will leave me to it). I try to involve my kids as much as possible in cooking and they already enjoy making cookies, cakes and popsicles. I like to bake so when it's their birthday I let them choose their favourite cake. This year I made a pirate ship for the youngest one and a treasure chest for my oldest. I am active in my children's school and I like to craft when there's time left, which isn't too much lately. Every night before I go to bed, I need to read at least a chapter in a book. It has become such a ritual that it is hard to sleep when I haven't. I do have quite a few cookbooks, but the ones I would miss the most if I'ld lost them (even if I don't make that much recipes out of them) are my great grandmothers cookbooks, which are partly just little pieces of paper with a recipe scribbled onto it. I also really like the cookbooks and tv-shows of Jamie Oliver and Nigela Lawson. I really like the countryside, even if I don't really live in it.

His was a short battle, but a courageous one. He was always my biggest fan, especially if I made peanut butter cookies. I miss him lots, but know he's not hurting anymore. I think he would be proud of the fact that I've been able to go on, and I'm still doing some of the things we liked doing together.

I have been married for 32 years and when we were newly weds my DH encouraged me to cook even though we would drink Alka-Seltzer for dessert most nights. I thought because I watched my mother cooking when I was growing up that I could just ?jump in? and start cooking. That was not the case. Chris and I found out the hard way. I have two little dogs Jake and Jillian. Jakie is a Japanese Chin and Jillian is a Pekinese. They are so adorable. They race from one end of the house to the other. Jake will watch for me from the front windows. The minute he hears the garage door he makes a beeline for the door with Jillian in tow. Such a nice welcome home at the end of the day. About a year and half ago my friends and I set up a Dinner Club which consists of three couples. Each month one couple hosts a dinner party. The hosts prepare the main entr?e. The guests bring an appetizer and a dessert. The only rule is that all recipes must be new. Tried and true reicpes are not acceptable. This way we get to prepare recipes for friends that we may never have tried. We rate the recipes at the end of the meal and share copies with each other. This affords us a chance to get together without letting too much time go by. Since joining Zaar a year ago I was adopted for the Spring 2008 Pick A Chef cookbook. Some of my recipes appear in the book. I am currently participating in the Zaar World Tour 4, visiting many countries and cooking a lot of foreign recipes along with my teammates. So far this has been very exciting. Again, trying new recipes that I would never have thought to cook has been amazing not to mention meeting people from around the world. This is a wonderful site with so much going on. The recipes I have tried to date have been fabulous. All the members are so nice and helpful.

94089,298757,https://www.food.com/user/298757,packeyes,"New wonderful site I just discovered: I am married to a wonderful man who gave me a premium membership for my birthday. As he said, he gets the biggest benefit from this membership, for $25 a year he gets to eat at a gourmet restaurant every night - our table :) I love trying new recipes. During the day, when I have to be away from my kitchen, I spend my time teaching 8th graders math. This summer I am looking forward to making recipes from the veggies in my garden - especially tomato sauces. Last year I made quite a bit of spaghetti sauces. Now that I've made spaghetti sauce from scratch I can't touch that stuff from the super market! This summer I want to find some pizza sauce recipes. If you know of any good recipes for preserving fresh veggies let me know! I have 3 cats who come running to the kitchen every time they hear a can open because they think it's cat food. The black one is Leila, The orange one is Sundrop (also known as Grover) and the gray one is Mist. Mist does not get along with the other 2 at all (she is old and set in her ways and didn't like to meet 2 new cats when my husband and I got married) so this picture is amazing that they are all that close and not fighting! They are very spoiled kitties. http://www.recipezaar.com/members/home/298757/IMG_6280.jpg We also adopted a greyhound this past February. She is a rescue from the race track, though she doesn't have a racing history. If you are looking for a perfect, easy maintenance dog, rescue greyhounds are it! She was already crate-trained - so we don't have to worry about messes in the house. All she does is sleep and go out for walks with us. Even the kitties have warmed up to her. I am always looking for new efficient tricks in the kitchen. My favorite kitchen ""gadget"" is my garlic grinder I got for Christmas. Recipezaar has become my favorite website and 90% of the recipes I cook come from here. I am enjoying writing my recipes down. I am the type of person who just throws some of this and some of that in to cook together and it usually turns out good so it can be difficult actually narrowing down the amounts - if you use one of my recipes keep that in mind and please adjust to your tastes! I am trying to get away from using the word ""delicious"", my husband pointed out to me that I use that word to describe every recipe I try. I can not cook without garlic, any recipe I try out that does not have garlic I add it in (except desserts). The way I rate recipes: 5 stars - stellar, this recipe will be added into my weekly dinner rotation. 4 stars - very good, either my husband or I really liked it but the other one just thought it was okay. 3 stars - okay, I will make it very occasionally. 2 & 1 stars - I don't rate many recipes this low, but I will if I followed all the steps exactly and it was not something we were able to finish eating. I usually try to put in my rating how I changed the recipe - this usually entails adding garlic. I am trying to cook healthy and yet still delicious. I buy all organic meats and dairy and I try to on produce. I am very wary of all the hormones and additives put in food and ultimately would like to cook everything from scratch - although I know this is a pipe dream at this point in my life. I detest fast food, I really believe that fast food is ruining the health of the majority of America (that and T.V. - but I won't get started on that).

My mother, a talented lady, taught herself to cook after she got married and turned out to be a wonderful cook. People everywhere rave about her meals. I am especially fond of the few traditional Polish dishes she makes. These days that only happens by special request. :o) When I was 18, I married into a Greek/Macedonian family and so my love of food was further expanded and enhanced. Those people can cook! Now married for a 2nd time to a true-blue Aussie guy, I struck gold again with a mother-in-law who was extremely talented in her kitchen. Unfortunately she's too elderly and unwell to weild her wooden spoon these days but I thoroughly enjoy discussing her favourite recipes and perusing her old cook books. Food has always been a huge part of my life. I love all types of cuisines. Hubby and I have 7 kids (his, mine and ours). At present (2010), they are 26, 26, 25, 24, 20, 11 & 9 years old. I get to practice in the kitchen a lot. Sometimes more than I really want to. LOL! The 5 older kids are no longer living at home but phone me with foody requests regularly. I LOVE it when they ask for a favourite dish to be cooked by me. I feel my job has been well done. :o) My 2 younger kids are a Mum's nightmare to feed. I don't know why, but these 2 are by far the pick-iest eaters of the 7. Still, they are asked to try new things regularly and I'm sure one day, they too will have a love of good food as the rest of us do.

94326,121684,https://www.food.com/user/121684,Kookaburra,"Above: Slideshow of our garden at Avalon Slideshow of our recent holiday at Woodgate Beach, South-East Queensland, Australia. Hi! I'm Kookaburra, from Australia. First, a promise. I will only post recipes on this site which I've made myself and to which I would personally give a 5 star rating - what you give them is up to you ;-) I look forward to receiving your feedback. If you look at my reviews, they're all 5 stars. That doesn't mean I give 5 stars to every recipe I try. I'm just not interested in giving poor ratings to anyone else's recipe because I accept that different people have different tastes. So, I've decided that I'll only review those recipes which I really love and which I'd make again and recommend to friends. If a recipe meets that criteria - even if it needs a bit of 'tweaking' to match my tastes, I'll give it 5 stars. If not, I'll just delete it from my recipe book and no hard feelings. I'm not advocating this as the 'right' approach. I just decided I needed a consistent strategy for rating and this is mine. I'm passionate about cooking - and eating! What I look for in food is something that 'zings' in the mouth. I like lots of taste - I'm not a big fan of subtlety. I don't often cook recipes exactly as written. I like to experiment and adapt things to my own taste. A retired marketing executive and academic, I live with my elderly (but thoroughly modern) mother in a tiny mountain village at the edge of the rainforest. I'm female, happily single, in my mid-40s and boast the Rubenesque figure of a passionate cook! Avalon, our 'story-book' cottage, overlooks a small lake. As I sit at my computer or work in the kitchen, I'm serenaded by a cacophany of native birds - including a very fat family of kookaburras! We have quite a large property and are lucky to have vegetable gardens and a variety of fruit and nut trees. I look forward to sharing recipes on Recipezaar with family, friends and friends I've yet to meet. last minute flight",Contributor,4.7,224,2004-01-01,2,20,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pie.png,1509

Talk about being out numbered. We relocated to Idaho after living in Washington for about 13 years. I love the Pacific northwest but have fell in love with Idaho too. The people are wonderful and the community is rural enough to give my children the childhood I want them to enjoy. I got my passion of cooking from my step mom she is an amazing cook who can improvise any meal and have it come out wonderful. I have no idea how she does it but its what I aspire to achieve. I stumbled across recipezaar by accident a few years ago while acquainting myself with the internet and have been addicted ever since. This cooking community of people just amaze me. I have been welcomed with a warmness that is unsurpassed. Everyone has shared their recipes, knowledge, humor, the lists goes on and on...U guys are wonderful. I tell everyone I know about this website in hopes of inspiring all of the would be chefs out there to keep experimenting because its doesnt have to be complicated to be yummy. I love preparing a meal that makes my family say make this again mom its great, its a satisfaction that my day to day job does not provide. My pet peeves are lying, selfishness and judgemental people. I am raising my boys to be loving and giving young men. I hope that my love of cooking rubs off on them and that they will remember the times we have shared playing in the kitchen.",Contributor,4.6,"Boise, Idaho",2004-04-01,0,2,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pop.png,5998

My love for humanity is based on fellowship rather than sensuality. I PROMISE that I will never share a recipe unless I have tasted the food. Most of the recipes are mine, but I have included a few classics, and some recipes that were written by very creative people, that are just so good that I had to share. From time to time I have found recipes with my name on them in print magazines, but they are always altered in some way by the publisher. So there is no reason why you should not add your own personal touch. If you leave this page with just one thought, I hope that it would be that Cooking is a Creative Sport. I grew up in Glenview Illinois, just north of Chicago. My Mother loved those little exotic cookbooks, that were sold as a weekly series in grocery stores in the 1950's. I was taught to eat whatever was put on my plate so I ate food from a different culture every week. If I had to pick a favorite, it would be Mediterranean. After leaving my Mother's table, I have lived and enjoyed eating in Colorado, Missouri, Montana and Nebraska, before settling in Saint Cloud, Minnesota in 1975. After a 30 year marriage with mixed reviews, I am now pleasantly single again, and plan to stay that way. Up until recently, I had occupied my evenings just talking with people and sometimes sharing recipes, while soliciting donations for Non-Profit Organizations. Yes .. that's right, for over 20 years, I was a Telemarketer. The perfect job for a Taurus. I enjoy reading cook books the same way most people read novels,and I am still improving my skills in the art of Solo Cooking. However; my true passion will always be sharing my favorite recipes with all of you.",Contributor,4.5,"Saint Cloud, Minnesota",1999-12-01,3,95,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/fruit-kebab.png,3208

I live alone now but my 2 DDs and 7 grandkids like just a few doors down so I always have a houseful I love to cook. It's really ALL about the food, isn't it? These days I look for recipes that are easy to prepare and easily made in smaller amounts, although I often will make a full recipe and freeze it in portions for days when I can't cook. Both DDs are my cooking buddies. Two or three times a week they come over and help with the prep and cooking, trying out the new recipes I've found here on Zaar. They also help with the eating, as do the SILs and grandkids. How I rate recipes: 5 Stars ~ Fabulous and I loved it just the way it is ~ Perfect. 4 Stars ~ Needs a tune up, a tweak here and there. A keeper. 3 Stars ~ A good idea that is not quite working. Repairs needed May or may not be a keeper. 2 Stars ~ This recipe would need a major overhaul to suit me. Probably will not make again. 1 Star ~ Just not my cup of tea ~ will not make again.",Contributor,4.4,,2005-06-01,4,4,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pop.png,2424
95167,355694,https://www.food.com/user/355694,Stoblogger,"I come from a very large family which attributed to my mother spending a great deal of her time in the kitchen cooking, cleaning, and preparing. I was fascinated at how she prepared wonderful dishes (especially desserts) without using a cookbook. We grew many of our own fruits and vegetables and my summers were spent washing jars and preparing fruit and vegetables for canning. I dreaded the mountains of green beans, tomatoes, peaches, etc., etc. that had to be picked, washed, peeled, snapped.... More than anything, I hated spending my summer washing jars! But now, I wouldn't trade that kind of upbringing for anything. I'm glad I learned how to do all those things because it's becoming a lost art. It really was a simpler time then and I'm a much better person for knowing how to do all those 'old fashioned' things. In my early years of learning to cook, I watched Julia Child on PBS every chance I got. I was so thrilled when I was about 11, my mother let me prepare Julia's Pastry Tarts. If I remember correctly they didn't turn out so well but it didn't matter. Oddly, today, I enjoy reading cookbooks and recipes even more than actually cooking.",Contributor,4.8,,2006-09-01,3,4,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/sushi.png,3620

I always try to offer substitutions in my recipes that can be made for my carnivorous friends. I believe that vegetarians can make just about ANY meat dish under the sun by making smart substitutions of vegetarian mock meats, tofu, or vegetables. If a dish calls for meat or poultry, I NEVER let that stop me.

95257,49561,https://www.food.com/user/49561,Smilyn,"As of 21 JUL 2010:  I am so darn disappointed with Recipezaar, now Food.com, again.  I have been with Recipezaar since 2002 and have seen so many different changes that the staff has created.  Each time I get used to it, but these last two times are just ridiculous.  I don't expect perfection from any site, but do expect some standards to be kept in place.  Many Recipezaar-veteran members were disappointed and placed their concerns with the community forums and even wrote to Scripps Network via snail mail.  This new Food.com is just another way to make it commercial like the rest of Scripps Network products.  I used to be really into Food TV and watch it alot, but it is so commercialized... how is it that every Celeb chef has their own knife set?  Really?  Look at Rachel Ray (for an example)... she makes it seem that she is down to Earth, but with her magazine, 4 - 5 TV shows, bakeware, cookbooks, etc. it gets old really quick that Scripps is out for money and hoping to just bank on us.  I'm all about making money and the American dream to make a profit, but does everything need to be so darn commercialized?  I even gave into the paid memberships on Zaar... ugh.  Such a scam, but I did it.  I know things move with the times and I embrace technology more than most, but things don't need to be so commericialized to be high tech.  So I am sure I will end up moving on, saving my recipes on my own computer, thus not sharing with the world.  Sigh.  I know that one less member Scripps has won't even make a dent, but at least I will feel better about it. About me is a whole lot so I'll narrow it down a bit. I love my family: the hubby and two beautiful, spoiled kids. We lived in Vegas for quite a while and moved to Florida. Since it's almost near impossible to have the hubby be an E-6 and me stay at home, I decided to go back to work. I love my husband so much. He never lets us do with-out, he protects us (and the country), he is very smart and he has such a great personality. We are still working on being handy around the house... LOL! He is that one in the party that can get along with almost everyone. He is true Cajun, raised in the deep south of Louisiana, so now I know what real Cajun food is. I really love my job as a gov't contractor. The people here treat me very well. I am truly blessed to have this job. I was previously in the military for 7 1/2 years. I have been to Uzbekistan (in support of OEF) and to Turkey(in support of ONW) (separate trips). I worked in the supply career field and pushed mo bags around (mobility bags carry our chemical warfare gear for deployments). Then I worked at a rescue squadron where I got to go on the 2 deployments above. I loved working there, but my boss was a jerk :) I applied to go into communications and was accepted. I went to school and was seperated from DH for 5 months for tech school :( It was hard. After school, we got pregnant with our DS. Sometimes he can be the sweetest boy. J/k, I love him. I heard boys don't grow out of it. Oh well, I always have my DD (2 years old) I love being on a low carb diet even if my recipes don't show it. 1/2 of them are from my mother-in-law (who happens to be a very good cajun cook) and some are from researching my Danish heritage. Some are because we love the recipe and want to share. I love scrapbooking and putting together my own cookbook from this website. I have over 300 recipes in a binder and I am still collecting. Someday it will be a published book :) I have found so many great ideas, recipes and advice.",Contributor,4.6,212,2002-07-01,3,11,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/drink.png,3798

My first real cooking experience was when I was 7. I came home from school one afternoon and felt like French toast. My elder brother was home with his friends and did not want to make it for me, so I got a pan out, put it on the stove, turned the stove on to high. After that I could not remember what to do, but I knew that French toast involved bread so I put the bread in the hot pan without grease and poured milk over it! Oy vey... My brother's friend asked me what I was trying to make and I told him. He laughed and told me I was making it wrong but he also taught me how to make French toast the right way. I came home every day after that and made French toast. I felt so confident with the little bit of knowledge I had acquired that I soon started experimenting with other things. Nothing was going to stop me! The first full meal I ever made for my family was boiled rice and oven roasted chicken pieces with a steamed vegetable medley. I was 8 years old and my mom was in hospital. My dad was struggling to hold down an intensely busy job, keep the family going and be with my mom, so I thought I would help him. I don't think he believed that I had done it on my own. I remember telling him that I read in a cookery book how to make a roast chicken but I did not know what ""a"" rosemary was so I just put the chicken in the dish without it.

My husband and I enjoy anything in the out of doors. Besides spending time with family and our animals, my family and I enjoy being involved in our church and spending time with friends. Although many of my recipes posted are of desserts I like to make for family or friends, I have for the last several years ascribed to a healthier lifestyle...eating lots of protein, veggies and fruits. No, I am not a low carber....I eat the right carbs....brown rice, whole wheat bread and all in moderation. I do have several recipes posted that I use often that adhere to these guidelines. When you combine eating nutrient dense foods with monitoring your caloric intake, you can't help but be healthy! There is an awesome free website that you can use along with Zaar to help meet these goals. It is www.calorie-count.com. It takes a day or two to learn how to use it...but it is a fantastic resource for anyone wanting to analyze what they eat and figure out what your caloric expenditures and allowances should be. Like Zaar it also had a wonderful community of people with a common interest...staying healthy while enjoying foods. OK...enough of the plug...but I really do love that website! Zaar has been great for finding recipes that fit this lifestyle...many recipes can simply be modified to be healthy. The variety this gives us has made the difference in getting the whole family to eat that way....that's right...I don't think my daughter has tasted white bread more than two to three times in her life!!!

In college I had a wonderful professor, Dr. Mark Woodhouse (his books are fascinating BTW) and I began my study of the paranormal, conspiracy theory, and metaphysics. I can honestly say it changed my life. I earned my degree in Philosophy with a minor in Religion and English. For those of you who are interested in Astrology, I am a Pisces Dragon. A great book (did I mention that I like to read a lot?) is The New Astrology by Suzanne White. She actually sums up my life very well when she says: ""Pisceans born in Dragon years will be touchy and argumentative until they finally stop trying to prove themselves.

I love to get out and ride my bike around town, and taking long walks is my favorite way of relaxing and feeling good.  I'm lucky to live just half a mile from a grocery store, so on nice days I like to take my handy rolling market cart and walk there.  Sometimes I do my best menu-planning while strolling along the sidewalk! My married daughter in San Antonio got my cooking gene for sure.  We love nothing better than getting in the kitchen together when I visit her, or when she comes home.  Holidays are our favorites---we like a pretty presentation and doing the tables, centerpieces, and so forth, as well as trying new recipes and menus.  She's recently added homemade baby food to her repertoire, now that she has a baby boy who lovvvvves to eat. I can't wait 'til he starts having birthday parties; while I don't eat sweets myself, I adore baking. The only sort of cooking I'm not overfond of is grilling out, but that's fine; my husband is the King of the Grill and takes over when we entertain outdoors.  I'm happy to do the appetizers and sides in the INDOOR kitchen! I love Italy and France, and have many recipes scribbled on napkins from my trips there.  I'm in an Italian study group, and the six of us enjoy getting together and trying recipes.  My husband and I are also in a supper club, and each month there's a different theme: one summer we hosted a luau with a variety of tropical dishes, and this past fall I built a menu around a French theme, with hearty boeuf bourguignonne (for my carnivorous friends). I was excited to be chosen Chef of the Day on October 17, 2009, and Chef of the Month in July '12. Thank you, Food.com, and all the friends/fellow cooks I've met here.

Feingold eliminates food additives such as artificial flavors and colorings, synthetic sweeteners such as Equal and the petroleum-based preservatives such as BHT, BHA and TBHQ (ewww!!) You can find more information on the Feingold program by visiting the website at http://www.feingold.org.

I am also interested in recipes having to do with homemade things (like extracts, seasonings, syrups, mixes etc.) I've realized it cuts down on spending and it is usually healthier than store bought. I'm always on the lookout for great appetizers for football season (GO RAVENS!!). I'm not sure if my brother and sister in law come over for football or the things I make to snack on for football!

96754,1375473,https://www.food.com/user/1375473,the80srule,"In advance, I'd like to thank everyone who reviews my recipes and leaves positive feedback! I know that I usually don't email anyone after getting a review, so I'd just like to thank everyone who reviews and submits pictures of my recipes in advance. It's much appreciated! I'm an accounting student who likes to believe it's still 1987. I'm trying to cook at home more so I joined up on here to swap recipes and get ideas, namely for someone with a limited budget and a ridiculously tiny cramped kitchenette. It gets hard for me to keep fresh ingredients around due to cost and spoilage, so most of my recipes call for canned stuff, but feel free to ""upgrade"" them with fresh ingredients! :) To update this a bit, I went from someone who was totally inept in the kitchen to a self-taught gourmet chef almost overnight. I'm quite proud of this feat and now look forward to things like grocery shopping and doing most of my cooking one day of the week to freeze and refridgerate stuff for future use, and keeping track of dates and perishability helped with my organizational skills. Cooking lingo looked like a foreign language to me, now I know it just as well as I know EPS and price-to-book ratios! I started out following other 'zaar users' recipes and from cookbooks, other cooking websites, etc. then started building on those to the point where I know enough about food structure and flavors to develop my own recipes. The dishes I'm now famous for are homestyle mac n cheese, mango shrimp, cheesecakes, and lots of pumpkin goodies with luscious buttercream frosting. There's some certain recipes that I'll probably stay away from for time, complexity, and budget limitations but I still didn't think I'd ever be able to make my own frosting or burritos. I like watching the Food Network to get ideas although god I wish I had one of those real kitchens heh. My favorite celebrity chefs are Paula Deen, Guy Fieri, and the Barefoot Contessa. I have a madcap and sarcastic sense of humor, which is evident in some of my postings. Not everyone gets it or just thinks I'm being mean or self-deprecating but I'm really not. I like to take things as they come in life and not take myself too seriously because life's just way too short. I live for the company of my friends, who are basically my family, and other warm, funny, and down-to-earth people. Two-faced people and people who act like they're better than me are unwelcome. Other things about me: I've been in college for almost an entire decade, I'm an old school gaming dork, and I clip coupons and look for savings religiously and however money I save on my purchases, gets contributed to my IRA. Don't think it's an effective strategy? I put $1,042 in there to date if that tells you anything! Ha my friends always tell me how much my accountant super-powers keep coming out off the clock. Although I like to view coupon clipping as more of a game rather than the headaches involved with at-risk rules and limit losses. I love cheese. Cheese is the word. I'm a pesco-vegetarian, so that means I'm always looking for innovative ways to use tofu-- baked, mashed, fried, stir-fried, you name it. I like some vegan foods but could never go vegan because of my love of cheese and I also use milk, butter, and the like frequently in my recipes...but as much as I love things like tofu, tempeh, soymilk, and ricemilk I just do not dig Soy butter and soy cheese. Totally not the same!! I don't eat poultry or red meat not because of moral objections for the way they're obtained, but for health reasons as well as I've just never been a meat eater. (Ever see the nasty conditions chickens are kept in? Yeah...makes me prefer tofu.) Don't like it, and cooking vegetables, cheeses, and vegan-friendly stuff is just far easier. At least if I don't fully cook tofu all the way, it won't make me sick. I'd rather get my proteins through tofu, nuts, legumes, and sometimes shellfish and use the calorie allowance on decandent desserts. (Which I've also gotten really good at making!) I love classic comfort foods like mac n cheese, grilled cheese with tomato soup, and chili cheese fries. I'm a big connoisseur of Mexican and Indian food, and I like to try cuisine from other cultures too. I'm always willing to try new things! My weird food quirks: Tomatoes. I LOVE tomato-based foods like pizza, pasta sauces, ketchup, tomato soup, etc. but will only eat raw tomatoes if sliced paper-thin on some sandwiches or finely, finely diced with Mexican food preferably with some cilantro. I hate them in chunks on salads and can't stand chunky tomato soups and sauces. Same with tomato peels! :: Salad dressings- except for some raspberry vinaigrettes, I totally despise packaged salad dressings. I thought Bolthouse Farms 1000 Island dressing was good at first until it gets that chemical taste a few days after opening. I think almost every store-bought salad dressing has this disgusting chemical or overprocessed taste to it whether it's Kraft or that $8/bottle stuff they sell at Whole Foods. But most salad dressings at restaurants, especially French, 1000 island, and buttermilk? I usually can't get enough! :: I hate, hate, hate mayonnaise but don't mind using it in my cooking and love mayo-based sauces and salad dressings. But plain? Ick. I also use Nasoya soy-based Nayonnaise to cut on fat, calories, and perishability and find that it works just as great if not better. If I could buy Nayonnaise by the crate or economy-size jug that would rule. BEST RESTAURANTS EVER: Jackson Diner, Queens NY: Best Indian food EVER. Menu prices are good considering the huge sharable portions and I get enough for 3 dinners out of the leftovers, but the lunch buffet is an AWESOME deal. Blockheads, various points of NYC: Great low-price Mexican restaurant that has healthier eats than other Mexican places, good drink specials, and just a fun place to be. I've got a lot of good memories of getting drunk with my girlfriends over foot-long burritos at this place. Caliente Cab Co, Murry Hill NYC: It's right next to Blockheads and it's a little more expensive but their margaritas are out of this world and you get heaping portions of awesome food. I highly recommend the bean tostadas and shrimp quesadilla. Kate's Joint, Lower East Side NYC: I've been going to this great vegetarian/vegan restaurant since 2003, I usually always get the Super Veggie Burger, McKate, or the Mock Popcorn Shrimp. I don't know what Abijah's Secret Sauce but it sure is delicious. A particularly funny memory I have of taking one of my friends to Kate's with me is when got inside and she asked the waitress, ""Dude, will Kate share her joints?"" Shady Maple Smorgasbord, East Earl PA: I've been going to PA Dutch Country with my family for vacations for 20 years, maybe farther back if my memory serves me well. Shady Maple's always been there. This place is just awesome. If you go during lunch hours, the buffet is about half the price as dinner and you get the same food. The new building it's in is just amazing-- there's the pizza bar, the steak bar, catch of the day bar, salad bar, 2 dessert bars, classic comfort foods, garden fresh greens, and don't forget their classic whole-wheat rolls with fresh creamery butter! There's something for everyone and even your pickiest kids will find something they love. And you can never go wrong with their shoo-fly pie and red velvet cake, which you can purchase in the Farmer's Market next door to take home. Also, you eat free on your birthday! La Barca, San Francisco CA: My family and I discovered this restaurant by accident in 2001 on a family vacation. At the time, none of us were really into Mexican food but were willing to give it a try because the place looked warm and welcoming and we saw everyone's plates had heaps of food. Well, that turned me on to Mexican food for good! I think La Barca is one of THE best Mexican restaurants in the freakin world. If I'm ever in SF for fun or business again, it's well worth the trip! The prices are unbelievable for the food you get-- and I never saw potato enchiladas anywhere else! The green enchilada is good too.",Contributor,4.4,,2009-09-01,0,21,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/drink.png,4424

After 21 years of marriage, got divorced and met a Brit living in the U.S. He decided to come back to his homeland and I came over here about a year later. We were married in October 2005. Here I am down at Viking Bay which is only two miles from our house. My hubby grew up down here and I love living near the seaside. We adopted two rescue cats in May 2007 and now I have some company during the day! (Yeah sure, great company they are when they sleep all day!) Our two 'children'... Noddy (Lord of Nottingham) Alfie (Sir Alfred) I really have it made I think. I have a husband who can cook! I cook during the week and Peter cooks on the weekends. I have included some of his concoctions in my list of recipes. Me at the Scotland border, August 2005 I'm still unemployed which gives me plenty of time to experiment in the kitchen. I love to cook and try different things and 'Zaar has really helped in that aspect. I'd love to start my own business someday selling some of my homemade creations. I'm a Betty Boop freak and have loads of stuff that I've collected over the years including a porcelain doll of her in a wedding dress and I even have her tattooed on my ankle. ~~~~~~~ I enjoy doing cross stitch, cooking, baking and entertaining and hubby and I love our wines! Some of my pet peeves are bad hygiene, rudeness, bad manners, laziness and people who litter. My favorite cookbook is my Betty Crocker Cookybook. I've had a copy since I was about 12 and it was falling apart. My brother got me a new copy a couple of years ago from ebay and it was a FIRST EDITION and was in excellent condition. Now that I'm here in England, I find myself collecting more cookbooks.

It is much more exciting than it sounds (well, except for the photocopying bit). I am English married to a Dutch bloke and we are both obsessed by food and travelling - hoorah! When I first joined Zaar my fave cookbooks were on the opposite ends of the spectrum: 'The Classic 1000 Quick and Easy Recipes' by Carloine Humphries and Gordon Ramsay's 'Just Deserts'. I hardly ever use the first book now because Zaar has replaced it. The second book can be extended to 'anything by Gordon Ramsay'. It is amazing that such a recognised chef can write recipes that always turn out well! What is particularly exciting about them is that when they aren't quite right I always know what I did wrong and can fix it the next time. When all said and done though, I really am a pudding cook. Main meals are great and I love them but I get much more pleasure from outrageous deserts. They have to be really outrageous though, with 6 eggs, a pint of cream and giant bars of chocolate. None of this delicate mousse type thing. I made a bavorois the other day and when all said and done it was just a posh mousse. I hope to post more recipes but finding the time is hard. When I review recipes I try to use the following ratings: 5 stars = great, I will make it again perhaps many times 4 stars = good, I will make it again but will probably adapt it 3 stars = ok, I may make it again but will definitely adapt it 2 stars = something went wrong 1 star = if I ever need to use this I won't post a review. I am too much of a scaredy custard I will always be honest and will try to give constructive feedback as well as say what I did differently. In cases where something went wrong I will try to explain why. Whatever rating I give though - thank you for posting.

I have a small garden in which I like to have the occasional dig. I like roses but have not been having much success with them here, too much shade. I also like to grow herbs and vegetables but sadly don't have much room for veges, so I keep a selection of herbs in the garden for use in the kitchen. I have worked in many jobs over the years, the ones that stand out in my memory as being good fun were as an assistant florist (with a girlfriend from school), as a carer for people with disabilities and in the theatre as a costumer. Costuming/sewing/pattern drafting/designing is a passion but sadly there is very little work here. What work is available is always being fought over by so many people. Also, unless you are in the 'club' then you barely get a look in. It's very sad but thats the way things work. I also love to read - anything I can get my hands on. The beach is always good in summer, and I really love to just sit around with my friends and relax and chat. I love my cat, whos name is Romany, but he lives with my parents. I live on a main road and although I have a small cat run built in the yard (for when he comes and stays with me) it is kinder to let him live in the house he has been in all his life.

Cakes, cookies, wedding cakes (baking and decorating), pastries, candies, chocolates...you name it...I've probably made it. I planted an herb garden 2 seasons ago and really enjoyed it and having been doing so ever since. I had fresh herbs all summer long and an abundance to dry and ""put up"" for the winter. Nothing beats your own fresh rosemary, basil, thyme and savory, sage, mint, oregano. I have five huge rosemary bushes that are thriving outside, despite frigid weather (it's quite hardy!). Rosemary is probably my favorite herb. I love to infuse oils...the safe way. I infuse them right before I cook with them, either with garlic or herbs or both. I love making simple syrups (I always use the 2 to 1 ratio: 2 cups of sugar to 1 cup of water...it IS a syrup). I love it in hot tea and in a variety of drinks...even homemade ice creams. I've infused simple syrups with rosemary, lemon, apple mint, lime and lavender. All were fantastic with a cup of, for instance, blood orange/pomegranate green tea, or even basic teas or plain green teas. They do wonders for iced teas also. Try sweetening your lemonade with a basil simple syrup, it's great! I always have them on hand. They take up a huge amount of refrigerator space, but I cannot do without them. I am an amateur photographer and just got my new Canon XSi 450D Rebel and am having such a great time with it. I'm currently experimenting with macro photography with some great lens diopters.

I am a (yet unpublished) fantasy writer that is lucky enough to have a husband who understands and accepts why I don't have a ""real"" job of my own. We have two kids (the purring kind) that are more than enough for the time being! I spend most of my non-kitchen time reading, playing video games of all kinds (yes, we girl gamers ARE out there, and we don't have to limit ourselves to casual games if we don't want to) and writing. My husband and I are working on an independent game design for a kid-friendly RPG that might go somewhere (well, we're hopeful anyway.) I tend to add things ""to taste"" and do not often measure ingredients for myself unless I am baking. Please take the listed amounts for my recipes as suggestions, not unbreakable rules. You should know what you like and there's no shame in following that. I don't expect everyone in the world to like the same level of salt, pepper and other seasonings that I do. Just go with your instincts. When in doubt, add to taste and stop when you're satisfied. You can always add more but you can't take it back out! I have been a type 1 diabetic since 1996 and I have been working hard to get myself back on track during the last few years, after spending several years in poor control. This also includes getting my weight down (ugh.) I am eager to try low-carb and low-fat options that still retain plenty of taste! Sugar itself is not the enemy but it does still add up to carbs, so I have to be cautious. My favorite cookbook would have to be Recipezaar! I don't often use formal cookbooks since I prefer to use my laptop to store everything safely. When I do, my favorite book would have to be my Taste of Home cookbook from 2003. It was my first cookbook and has some amazing recipes in it that I would love to make more often.",Contributor,4.7,,2005-07-01,0,3,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pie.png,5093

101794,353381,https://www.food.com/user/353381,Mrs.R,"I am a fun 28-year-old gal. Married to a really fun 34-year-old guy. We are expecting our first baby in July 2010! Mrs. M is my mom, and Mrs.J is one of my sisters. My family is very important to me. I'm the oldest of 11 kids, 2 boys and 9 girls. We range in age from 7 to 28! And we're the best-looking bunch of kids you could find! I love to travel, and have been to lots of different countries, mostly in the Middle East and Asia. I'm a Christian, and have spent many years doing overseas mission work. I like to meet new people, and I love to make people feel at ease, comfortable, welcomed. I am outgoing and love to laugh! I enjoy learning new things and never finishing them, gardening, learning frugal tips, games, trying to live environmentally healthy, and researching anything. I'm very passionate about God, relevant Christianity, worship and music, and helping people understand missions and the dynamics of overseas adaptation. I like anything that is different and unique, sometimes playing the devil's advocate, but yet at times I find myself very conventional. I'm trying to learn how to cook....and thanks to the 'Zaar, I'm slowly learning! But I'm not very good yet, and not quite confident to cook for others(besides DH), but that may be related to my perfectionistic tendencies. Most of the stuff I know how to make I've learned to make as I've traveled and lived overseas. I didn't grow up learning how to cook(I had ZERO interest), and when you stay overseas, you have to learn to cook really fast. A couple of years ago, I found myself in a bind in Afghanistan with only basic ingredients, onions, flour, eggs, rice, lamb, chicken, spices, etc. I didn't know what to do with any of these ingredients and I was in charge of daily supper! The only thing I had ever made from scratch was cookies, and chocolate chips were definitely NOT available! :) So between once-a-week access to a sketchy satellite internet connection, a couple of cook books that were brought from the States, and lots of help from Afghan women, I began to build a repertoire of basic things, all made from scratch. When I returned from the States and started enjoying convenient food again, I couldn't forget the frustration I felt in Afghanistan of not being able to cook, and I really began to miss the hours in the kitchen I spent with my Afghan friends. I also knew I would be traveling a lot more in the future and so in order to avoid hunger in other countries, I took up an interest in cooking! Since Afghanistan, I've traveled to more places, and everywhere I go, I always hang out in the kitchen with the women....talking, laughing, learning, picking up any neat little tips, and adding more recipes to my ever-growing list! I'm still very much in a learner/observer mode. And I have A LOT to learn!",Contributor,4.7,,2006-09-01,8,3,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pop.png,1886

I am originally from Madrid, Spain but to look at me you would never know that. I do not look the part of the misconception that most people have of the stereotypical Spaniard. But most people don't understand that the original Spaniards were blonde and blue eyed. That is the category that I fit into. And of course that means Royalty and they don't call me a Princess for nothing! Just kidding, but I am so very proud of my heritage and love to joke about the royalty part since I have the coloring. I have a 16 year old son that is growing so fast I am not sure where the time went, but have loved most every single minute of it. He is the light of my life. I am so lucky to have such an incredible child. I am married for the second time to the most amazing man and we have been married for almost 9 years. Seems just like yesterday when we met. He makes me laugh all of the time and most importantly he LOVES my cooking. :-) But I believe that even if I didn't cook that would be allright with him. That I cook and cook well (at least in their opinion and that is all that matters) that is a bonus, he says. Living here in Texas has been quite an experience. It is just a bit hot for my tastes and I think also for my husbands. Our goal is to make it to Colorado one day. I want the snow. Not this darned heat we have so much of. We do have a good start on the idea of being in the cold, since we have the 3 Siberian Huskys. We adore them and want to go to Colorado or somewhere that it is cold, for them, my husband tells me. :) He says we have a good start on our sled team. What a comedian he is. Anyway, that is pretty much me in a nutshell.

102043,567251,https://www.food.com/user/567251,birdie 3 andrea,"i like cooking (simple things usually) and i think i have a pretty good taste for good food. i have some basic cooking tips/rules that i would like to share... 1) don't mess with the cook. lol this rule is very important. i mean if i am multi-tasking, the last thing i need is someone telling me how to do something. unless you are going to be the one cooking it...shut up please. cooks also do not need anyone bitching about all of the pots and pans we use either. so it is best to just kick everyone out of the kitchen. you should be able to enjoy cooking. 2) you have to start with a clean kitchen. clean the dishes. bleach the sink, disinfect the counter tops with soap and water. doing this makes the kitchen a more comfortable place. plus you aren't dreading any piled up dishes. 3) try to accumulate an assortment of spices over time or grow your own. growing your own is a lot cheaper. i paid about $2 for a basil plant, which grew about 4 times it's size in a matter of weeks and now i can use basil whenever i want or you can go to the store and pay about $4 for like 10 leaves that always seem to spoil within a few days. 4) when using fresh ingredients i have a few tips...especially when it comes to tomatoes. DON'T refridgerate your tomaters okay people! unless you like mushy tomatoes. the only exception is after you have already cut into it. onions don't belong in the fridge till you cut them either. also you can wrap a paper towel around cilantro and green onion or really any leafy vegetable that is damp. this will help it from spoiling so fast in the fridge. 5) always use vegetables and fruits that have a good flavor and texture. this goes for every ingredient in everything you cook. if you use an unripe tasting tomato sauce in your food...your food is going to have a sour taste. very important. do the taste test. 6) of course always wash your hands. especially after handling any raw meats. 7) watch your food cook. some people like to leave the kitchen and let stuff cook but unless it is a roast or carefully timed you run the risk of eating charcoal for dinner. my sisters favorite! lol 8) if you are really serious about cooking, don't have a tile countertop. grout is a bitch to clean. 9) don't get all crazy with the salt shaker and don't add any salt or pepper when you are angry. lol that comes from personal experience. lol you can always add salt and pepper after your dish is cooked. besides some people are sensitive to salt. nobody wants swollen ankles or super high blood pressure in the morning. lol 10) if you have time, clean the dishes or what you can, while you cook. it really makes things easier. i mean you are already in the cooking mood. just do it. who wants to do the dishes after they eat? lol 11) have your refridgerator and cupboard organized. that way you know what you have and can use it before it goes bad. it helps prevent overstocking too. my mother has like 10 bottles of red wine vinegarette in her cupboard that accumulated over time. i was like ""hey are you going to open a grocery store in here?"" lol 12) don't feel that you have to follow recipes exactly. if you know something will taste good added or subtracted to it, do it! experimenting makes cooking a lot easier and more exciting. sometimes i will just use the temperature and cooking times and completely ignore the rest of the recipe, doing my own thing. 13) have the garbage in an accessible location. 14) be a mad scientist in the kitchen. 15) oh and don't ever think you know it all or that you are the best because everyone has something different and great to share when it comes to cooking. you learn new things all the time. so be open to new ideas. just don't put up with any crap once you have started cooking whatever you have decided to cook. lol some really good things to try if you haven't already.

He's a ""chop it up small and throw it in a dish"" kind of a guy, and I prefer to follow recipes that others have had success with.

Cooking, on the other hand, is something I've only recently started enjoying -- I love having adventures in different parts of the world, and when I can't do that, I love having adventures in the kitchen. So I experiment a lot with new recipes and I'm always in search of the perfect version of something. I moved up to NYC a couple of years ago for work, and it's been heaven. The food in this city is fantastic, and I especially enjoy going out into Queens for ethnic dining.

I live way out in the country so it's hard to find fresh herbs, and it's hard to make a quick trip to the grocery store to buy a missing ingrediant. We have to drive 30 minutes to get a gallon of milk! I enjoy healthy cooking. If you find a recipe of mine on here it's most definitly healthy. And I always tweak my recipes to become even more healthy for you. Like cake recipes I always replace the oil with natural applesauce which I think gives everything a better flavor. I'm not an expert on foods, however I would love to goto culinary school. I enjoy watching people cook on TV. I DO watch Emeril, and everything on food network. I love to watch the Cooking Episodes on the Health Channel. It really does give you some ideas for healthy meals. And in order to cook a recipe out of a Muscle and Fitness Magazine you got to be ready to tweak the ingrediants and get creative, because not all of them will turn out tasting the best. I also subscribe to Light n Tasty. I look forward to my new issue ever 2 months. I love that magazine. It's truely one of my favorites. It's alot better then Cooking Light if you ask me. School, my most favorite of all subjects is History. I LOVE IT! I always like to watch the educational channels as much as any ol' channel. I have a big interest in past wars, and politics. I'm not saying that I want to be president, I'm just saying I am very controversial whenever it comes to politics. And the 2000 election was so obvious, I knew George Bush would get it. Believe it or not, my mom asked ME who she should vote for. And I had already considered the pros and cons of George and Al, so I was 100% George Bush. Well, I'm going to go.

102855,151325,https://www.food.com/user/151325,Mrs B,"I live with my husband and 2 cats in Worcester Park; a quiet typical 1930s suburb (which no one has ever heard of!) about 12 miles South West of London. I'm a fair weather gardener and as my husband is a vegetarian I grow a few easy vegetables, such as tomatoes and peppers, mainly in containers. My husband loves growing flowers, the brighter the better, and we have a pretty garden as a result. Our cats, Araminta and Purrl, like it too! I do a lot of cooking and try to keep our diet as healthy and varied as possible. Although I work full time, I use very little in the way of pre-prepared foods. This is partly because of the limited choice of vegetarian meals, which I think are overpriced anyway; but mainly because I like to know what goes in my food! I love using the Internet for all the great ideas it gives me. Last year I participated in the Zaar World Tour (under my previous public name Caroline Blakey), which was great. Mr B and I tried lots of new foods and discovered new favourite meals. Researching recipes for the Tour was really interesting, however as I didn't have time to try them all, some were posted untested. I'm still working my way very slowly through them. To make matters worse I keep seeing other recipes I want to save and have also participated in Zaar world Tour II. So many recipes, so little time to make them! My 'rules' for posting recipes are a) if I wouldn't make a particular recipe, I won't post it and b) if my husband wouldn't eat it, I won't post it. This means that all my recipes are vegetarian friendly. As you will see from the number of recipes saved in my cookbooks, I particularly enjoy making jams and chutneys; I'd say it was one of my favourite hobbies. We always have a good supply of home preserves; my friends and work colleagues are well supplied too. If we won the lottery (say £5m, as a good number) we'd like to give up work, move to the country and buy a place with a bit of land. In my dreams this would be a manor house or old vicarage, with a walled garden, an orchard where I could keep hens, a vegetable garden, etc, etc, etc! In my more realistic moments (the £1m win perhaps) I would like to run a B&B, perhaps offering Vegetarian taster weekends. Luckily it costs nothing to dream.......I’d also love more time to read, do embroidery, learn a language, see more of the countryside; and of course play on Zaar.",Contributor,4.5,"Worcester Park, Surrey",2004-07-01,0,7,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pop.png,910

102900,237783,https://www.food.com/user/237783,Mareesme,"I've loved Zaar for many years and the great recipes I've found here. Back when I was working and the kids were little I was an okay cook who excelled only at a few family recipes. I began ""surfing"" on Zaar and started making so many wonderful fast and easy recipes. As they got older and I had more time, I began making more adventurous meals. Zaar's fabulous cooks have helped me every step of the way. Thanks to the Zaar family of cooks and the enthusiasm for cooking I developed through them, I'm now considered a good cook and develop many of my own recipes. When the kids were grown and I was no longer working, what started as a place to find new recipes turned into a community made up of varied and interesting people. After years as a ""recipe surfer"", I became a premium member in 2005 not only to start organizing recipes but also to participate even more in discussions, forum activities and having fun with new friends. I am hoping you enjoy the recipes I have posted and welcome comments. I try to thank everyone who reviews one of them, but if I ""drop the ball"" or if you can't receive Zmail, please know how much I appreciate you taking the time to make one of my recipes. I'm a dinosaur when it comes to taking digital photos of my recipes and getting them into my computer. Because of that, cyberhugs go out to anyone who takes the time to take/post pictures of my dishes in Zaar! I've had vision problems plus a retina disease called retinopathy prematuria since birth, but never let it stop me until the last few years when I had to quit driving becauser of it. I moved from ""sweet home Chicago"" to rural San Diego County, CA, in 2004 when my husband of 35 years retired. Sadly, we are not near our children and beautiful grandchildren, who live in Florida, Minnesota and Arizona. Zaar has helped the transition from moving from the city to the country and becoming an empty nester confined to home a little more bearable. I still love to read my grisly crime novels, play on the computer, and play blackjack at local casinos (within reason, of course??)

I’m absolutely passionate about food. My love of cooking / baking and all things food is only rivaled by my love for interior design and my in-depth interest in forensic science (what a combination). This explains my ""OFF BEAT"" humor! It wasn't always that way, I used to make a joke that my first marriage ended in divorce because of my then disdain for the kitchen... WOW HAVE I CHANGED! I’m really an artist at heart, everything I’ve ever been involved in or am doing currently revolves around the creative within me. For over 15 years I was in business for myself (The Salon Industry) where I met my now present husband. We currently own and operate our own Consulting / Marketing / Advertising firm, catering primarily to real estate agents and their properties. Yes, I have a techy background that spills into our business which is unique in that we handle all the details from start to finish. Business interests take us deep into the internet...a story on it's own! I collect chefs (yea,you read right), cookbooks and dishes. The dishes / table settings are in every color and style imaginable. I love to set theme tables that emphasizes the food (that’s the artist in me). I have an insatiable interest in cooking techniques and ingredients, especially the exotic. Our home is blessed with an array of cats, a dog, hamsters, exotic birds and tropical fish. There’s a whole lot of God, love and laughter being served along with the food here! I adore this site and I tip my hat to all the staff and ‘zaar contributors.

She is an inside sales rep and I work as a project coordinator with a small construction firm. My husband is still working in Texas for now, but that will soon change and he will be joining me here in Alabama. I just want everyone who reads my profile knows how much I love this site.

Of course I love looking at any and all recipes for some reason even though I'm not a cook. I'm for anything that is quick and easy - in and out of the kitchen in record time. I especially love crockpot/slow cooker recipes. I spend most of my time reading, but I do enjoy counted cross-stitch also. I love playing around in the water (not a very good swimmer). My husband and I had Mason, an 8 year old Cocker Spaniel (who recently passed away - he will be missed very much as he was a huge part of our family), Pretty Boy, a 5 year old Cockatiel, and a recent addition to our growing menagerie, Pat, a blue conure whose vocabulary includes: ""Hello"", ""Luv U"", ""What you doin"", ""All Right"", and ""Pretty Pat"". We are both into collecting: He loves collecting Dragons & Wolves, and I'm into Tweety Memorabilia and Bells. My dream is to travel through Alaska one of these days.

Honestly, this town would make Mayberry RFD look like a hugh Metroplex. It was quite a culture shock. Before I moved my dear friend and I were talking about opening a catering service and due to circumstances, that never worked out. My way of cooking has changed quite a bit since I am from Texas and this is the Deep South. Coming here to ""retire"" was one thing but after a year my daughter and granddaughter decided to come here and they moved in with us. She works part-time as a substitute in the elementary school and since I am disabled it's a blessing she is here with me. I have a Son and Daughter-in-law in Dallas with two other grandchildren that I miss dearly. I love to bake but I, myself,am not a big sweet fan. Have to have a real craving. Since I had such an extended array of friends and family back home I still have trouble cooking for a smaller family but isn't that what we have freezers for? I also now have a garden and love to do canning.",Contributor,4.8,,2007-08-01,0,3,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/taco.png,5179

One of the wedding gifts I recieved was an handwritten cookbook from my grandmother who collected all the family recipes from over the years, it is so treasured to me. I began my journey in cooking though that cookbook, and now i consider myself a pretty good cook ;p at least i've been told so!! :) Hope you will give some of my recipes a try!

When I got married I moved to Wyoming. Talk about culture and environment shock!! I love animals, especially dogs. We try to get rescue dogs, particularly huskies. We currently have 2 huskies - one Siberian male and one Alaskan female. Huskies have so much personality! I am a fan of the childrens books about Winnie the Pooh. I especially love TIGGER. Actually I love just about everything Disney. One of the things I miss most from living in Florida was getting to go to Walt Disney World anytime I wanted to. It really is one of the happiest places on earth. I love to cook and am always trying a new recipe. I also like to garden, but find it quite a challenge here in Wyoming with our long winters and dry windy short summers. I like to experiment with herbs and spices. During the summer of 2006 I was diagnosed with PCOS and as such realized that the excess weight I was carrying was quite literally killing me. I found SparkPeople.com and was able to lose over 75 pounds now with not too much more to go. My cooking has changed some since then in that I still cook the same foods I just go about it in a much healthier way.

117381,38717,https://www.food.com/user/38717,Judy-Jude,"Recipezaar Editor: Thank you for visiting Judy-Jude's page. Sadly, Judy-Jude passed away on January 8, 2009. She had many friends here, and she will be missed. I have been a member on Zaar since 2002 and I am addicted to Zaar. I want you all to never give up hope fighting cancer and giving your loved ones the hope to keep going. I am a cancer survivor, since February of 2004, when I had surgery for lung cancer. I received so much support from all the members on Zaar and I am so grateful to everybody that encouraged me to get stronger each day. In January (2006) my dear husband and best friend died, once again the Zaar family was there for me. In May of (2007) I was admitted to the emergency room for a problem with my intestines, at that time I learned that my lung cancer had returned but in an area, that is not operable in my thorax area. I went through my reconnective surgery on my intestines first and no cancer was found there. In August, I was strong enough to begin radiation treatments and I thankful so write that, to date, the radiation is working on reducing the tumors. I am now addressing an issue with the return of cancer in my upper lobe of my left lung. I am hopeful that I can start a new chemotherapy regimen to fight this, once again. May 28th 2008, When my ability to communicate via E-mail was difficult, I knew I had some serious issues going on. I was elated when I had my CAT Scan in April because it indicated that the Chemo Tarceva pill and that I take each day, appears to be working, the new spots on my left lung and not gotten larger. Dr. Sims, who put me on Tarceva, was very pleased. A follow-up visit a couple days later, indicated that the tumors that were treated, continued to shrink, Dr. Nixon was so pleased. Both of my specialists felt that I was just weak and once I got some weight back on, this would go away. It got worse, I had such little energy, it was difficult to put 8 hours of work each day. I could barely get my words out, my dear friend Louise took me to the ER that Exeter Hospital, the staff was wonderful, I think they felt that I was having a stroke. The ER doctor was wonderful and suspected the cancer had spread or I had pressure on the brain, causing this. The MRI indicated the mass in the head, which was a large tumor putting pressure, therefore, that acted similiar to a stroke. Luckily I caught it before it hit my whole right side. On June 9th I had my operation, appears to be a success and the tumor had not attached to the brain tissue. I came home on June 13th, Louise my dear friend stayed with me at night and we had some fun!! On Monday afternoon, when she came to stay, I sent her on way because I can stay alone at night now. I am bouncing back!!! go for radiation again, but I know the Staff and Mark Wentworth Hospital from my previous radiation treatment and I adore Dr. Nixon. Time to get well and continue the fight!! Speach stutter is almost gone and the ability to type is back!!!! I have a wonderful support system of friends and co-workers and of course Zaar. Great site.....great Zaar family to belong to. I can't ever thank each and every member enough for all their on-going prayers and support. I love to cook and share recipes. My favorite cookbook is ""Italian Family Cooking"" by Anne Casale. I enjoy gardening and my hobby is stained glass projects. Enjoy all the time I can with dear friends.",Contributor,4.6,United States,2002-04-01,1,7,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pop.png,4504

I have the mountains, the beach, and high desert all within two hour drive. Time taken for trips to the Pacific Coastline renews me when I am worn out and stressed.?

My husband was stationed there for 3 years ago and while we enjoyed our time in Wyoming, it is wonderful to be in a place with culture and diversity again. We are the parents of two very quirky yet very lovable cats, Mateo (6) and Kassie (5). We enjoy experimenting with a variety of cooking styles and love to adventure with new and different types of cuisine both when we dine out and cook. I maintain a vegetarian diet primarily and my husband is a shameless carnivore, so this often calls for a little creativity in the kitchen. Thankfully, I have found so many great recipes on Recipezaar that comply with both of out diets. One of my favorite things to do is invent new meals with unexpected ingredients in my kitchen such as tofu or spinach.",Contributor,4.3,,2007-08-01,0,0,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/taco.png,1520

My favorite things to do for fun are go out for a jog, spend time outdoors with family, have dinners on the backyard patio, and just spend time with my friends. Now we are remodeling our basement, and my room will be down there! It will be nice to just get away sometimes. We currently have no pets, but the critters in the woods sure call our yard their home! A few days ago, we found a couple of snakes in our garage. I freaked out! I am so petrified of snakes, spiders, and any bug that looks sort of creepy! Well, I hope you enjoy my recipes!

I discovered this site when I was looking for something new and different to cook. I like anything thats quick and easy but tasty. With a new baby I really don't have a lot of time to spend in the kitchen but got tired of eating hamburger helper lol. I have gotten a lot of wonderful recipes from this site I just feel bad that I don't have many of my own to add. For fun I used to read but can't seem the time to do much of that latley but when I do I like Patricia Cornwell. I like taking my kids to the park or beach when its nice out. I love playing with my son and watching him grow everyday its something new with him. Me and my husband like going to the movies and concerts when we can actually find someone to babysit. Well thats about it for now.,Contributor,4.6,,2008-12-01,0,0,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/drink.png,2390

I'm sixteen years old and love to cook. Seriosuly , I always bug my mum when she's coming home - "" Can I boil an egg ? Do you want me to put on the pasta ? "" etc - and I have little tradition where I cook a complete dinner once a fortnight. Thats' generally what I review recipes for as I don't get a chance to cook the rest of the time :( Since I live in Hong Kong, I don't have access to a lot of the stuff most Recipezaar-ers in the US do , so I spend a lot of time filtering out refrigerated buttermilk biscuits , frozen pie shells, pastry flour and all those instant mixes >< Its' not just that I live in Hong Kong though , my pantry (physically impossible in a two-bedroom flat, but there in mind and spirit) is small. What I always have in the kitchen : plain flour, self-raising flour, sugar, cocoa, pasta, canned beans, canned tomatoes, fresh tomatoes, garlic, onion, some kind of cheese, low-fat yogurt, low-fat milk, water, frozen berries, muesli. I guess a love of food is born in as I'm half-Italian. I go to Sicily every summer and its so different from here - there is this ...respect for food. I LOVE IT The other half of me has an ex-baking grandma ( she stopped after she had no-one to fatten up ) and I think I got a bit of that too , I absolutely ADORE making cakes, cookies,muffins but I hate having them around the house . I mulled over the idea of selling my baked stuff but in the end decided I'd probably get arrested for hawking and no-one would know what I was doing anyway. My rating system - ***** Perfect. this is for whatever the recipe claims to be, i.e. if a recipe a simple,quick, economic stew I won't give it *** for not being finicky or delicate. These are often foolproof, too :) **** Almost perfect, but there was something missing. *** All right . Not a bad recipe, but I didn't like it. ** Not enjoyable, but with some spark or facet with merit. * Godawful. SORRY !",Contributor,4.1,,2005-11-01,0,2,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pasta.png,3286

He is my best friend and my biggest cheerleader in all that I seek to do. We have been married 24 years this Feb of 2005.And together we have 4 boy's aged from 21-9. We live on the central coast from originally the central valley of california. Although it is beautiful here it is expensive and we miss the special friends we left. We now know that the beauty of your surroundings can only take you so far,eventually life finds you no matter the paradise you live. The thing that brings me joy is to see the expressions on peoples faces when they are enjoying what was prepared. Especially when I bring some goodies to a group function and people are not expecting it. People really do appreciate when we give of ourselves in cooking. I have learned a lot while cooking for various functions and groups at my church as well as for friends parties in the past. One is not to PANIC when things do't go as planned. Iv'e learned the art of improvision with grace. Most importantly, as long as I am cooking with love and putting my heart into it the end result will come together in spite of all the stress I expend. Better to ride the wave and enjoy the scenery. My passion? To make people feel at home and welcome no matter where we are together,the best way to do that is with food and the personal touches that come with hospitality and making people you serve feel special. Beyond that I like to write, usually as things come to me. I am not a very organized writer,although I am trying to dicipline myself to be, yet not loose the freedom of my writing. My pet peeve.. I don't have my husbands metabolism, he can eat and not gain weight...and people who think they are better than someone else and show it with arrogance and rudness, people in all social classes and races fall into that trap.",Contributor,,"Clovis, CA",2001-06-01,0,0,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pop.png,5485

145450,543183,https://www.food.com/user/543183,Converting to vegan,"I'm Scottish and have lived in North America for 17 years (8 in Canada, 9 in the USA). I have been 100% vegetarian for the past 6 years, and only ate fish once or twice a month before that for another 8 years or so. Now I'm eating vegan about 80% of the time and always looking to try out new and tasty recipes. I live in Ohio now, and although it is beautiful, one of my pet peeves is the absolutely atrocious food available in restaurants and more specifically the lack of veggie options. When dining with friends I get so mad (inside of course) when they say: ""oh look there's a couple of salads you can have"". I don't go out to eat salads; I want a meal! Well, this is one of the main reasons I cook so much and enjoy cooking so much too. It is extremely gratifying when I invite people to the house and they enjoy what I make by really diving into the food. I also enjoy gardening, so in the summer I cook and can like crazy preserving tomatoes, cucumbers, tomatillos, peppers, zucchini and lots of herbs. I am a professor at a local university and love my job. I feel that I get paid to do a hobby. However, I am ultra busy so I like to make things that are quick and simple or things that I can freeze and reheat at a later date.",Contributor,4.5,,2007-07-01,0,0,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/taco.png,4226
145504,1185662,https://www.food.com/user/1185662,yellow_apple30,"I love to cook. My idea of the perfect gift is a cooking gadget, which amuses my family to no end. I was given the choice of a lovely sapphire ring as an anniversary gift or a set of titanium cookware, and it was really no shock to anyone that I chose the latter. I am particularly interested in heart-healthy cooking and love to find recipes that are both healthy and jam-packed with flavor. However, that said, I do not try to make healthy desserts. I’d rather have a smaller portion of a decadent, naughty sweet than an entire tray of something that tastes wholesome. I am a Marine wife, happily married to the kindest, sweetest military man there is. I am a stay-at-home mom to a daughter and two dogs, a Pug and a Dachshund. I am a massage therapist with the goal of going to nursing school, hopefully in the next couple years. I did not grow up in a family where cooking was an integral part of our lives. My bag of cooking tricks has next to nothing learned from my mother or grandmother, so I am very much starting from scratch. At first, I needed to learn to cook the basics so I could provide home cooked meals for my husband and daughter. However, in a surprise twist, I actually enjoy cooking. I like the entire process. I like to make as much as I can homemade, and I enjoy the challenge of cooking dishes that don’t utilize premade, store-bought shortcuts. Unfortunately, I don’t have any friends who enjoy cooking. This is a real bummer for me since there’s almost nothing I enjoy more than sharing my recipes and having others share theirs. Since we are a military family, there is always the hope that when we relocate I may meet other home cooks who love to share their secrets. Until then, I’ll have to get my food fellowship time in online. When not in the kitchen, my number one favorite thing to do is read. I have a degree in English Literature that enriches my life to no end but has not turned into something I’d like to do as a career. I often read a novel while cooking, which explains why the books I pass onto friends often have olive oil or tomato stains on some of the pages. I also enjoy writing, though I don’t seem to have the attention span to finish much of anything. I am currently writing product reviews for a green living blog. I am not a social butterfly, a personality trait I have tried to change but to no success. Give me time alone with a good book or a page to write, or give me quality time with my family or one of my three close friends (all of whom are several hundred miles away from me), and I am completely content. The only part of socializing I enjoy is being able to cook or bake for others. Put me in the kitchen during a party and I’m all set!",Contributor,5.0,,2009-02-01,1,0,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/sushi.png,2850

We love going out to eat (especially Ethiopian and veggie sushi) and trying new recipes at home. We love it when we accidentally stumble upon a new recipe by accident when trying to do something else entirely, haha. I also love animals, photography, painting, exercise (mainly Tae Bo, hiking, and bouldering), museums, art galleries, old movies, making crafts with my hubby, reading, volunteering at our local animal shelter, and learning how to make a website for our natural soap-making business!

He is more needed as the lead guitarist, and when i am on bass no one plays keys because its not as necessary. Rude people bug me, especially rude drivers.

I have a small catering company, but cook often and big, mainly as a creative outlet. I love to peek into other foodies pantries and learn from all the wonderful diverse and creative cooks out there. I was raised in a very small town, Eldorado, in Southern Illinois. My grandma, Aunts and neighbors were all great cooks, but I am mostly inspired by my Mom who always encouraged me with her simple and easy way of making everything she cooks taste delicious. I grew up eating the most basic family dishes that are still the root of where most of my ""concoctions"" come from. I love to feed people and feel that food is the perfect way to show someone that you care about them and that they are special. As my family is now grown, my boys have developed a whole new appreciation of the family meal and I know that they will take many happy memories with them throughout their lives because of our times in the kitchen.",,,,2008-01-01,1,0,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pasta.png,1298

Used to live much closer to the city (4 years back) but moved closer to husband's new job and son's special school. Was really unsure of the 'burbs but wouldn't move back into the city now. More trees - hills, bigger house, much better. Still, the city had it's delights food wise. Within a short distance was the popular ""Lygon Street, Carlton"" and ""Brunswick Street, Fitzroy"" eateries. Restaurants seemed to change weekly. We enjoyed Brunswick Street - because after serious renovations to old house, you could stroll along the street and have coffee etc wearing paint-covered clothes with plaster dust still on your face. Lygon Street's more upmarket - but being near a university - you still don't have to dress up. I guest that might summarise my feelings about food. Nothing pretentious - but to be enjoyed. Food and relaxation go together for me. Be it in a restaurant or at home. So, back in the 'burbs food isn't quite as exotic but because our area is popular with wealthy Chinese immigrants - there are some great yum-cha places and Indian restaurants. Okay then, all time favourite cookbook? Perhap's a Madhur Jaffrey book on Indian food that is a treasured gift. Passions? Wine, food, reading and creating an environment that is relaxing for all the family. Pet peeves? Negative people - people who talk but don't listen - self-centred people. Month off? Pure relaxation. Actually - this is a hard one 'coz it seems so unlikely. What do I do? Apart from managing the domestic front, I have a degree in Linguistics but have found parenting a challenge (one child has an autism spectrum disorder), and haven't done anything more with the degree. I do work - I do freelance writing for educational software. I love books but refuse to pay full price for them - hence, find garage sales and second hand shops are an amazing source of quality literature at a reduced price. Also love picking up cookbooks this way.",,,"Mount Waverley, Victoria",2003-04-01,0,0,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/burger.png,2226

I'm 100% health freak. I don't cook often, but I love to cook non-healthy meals for my family and eat my own versions of the same using low calorie ingredients (because my family cringes at the thought of not using loads of butter in EVERYTHING). I waste a ridiculous amount of time on recipezaar saving recipes that I hope to eventually make some day (right now, I have over 2,600 recipes in my main cookbook) but, because I'm a poor college student living in a dorm, I'm restricted to microwave cooking-only. Joy. - _ - I'm studying at a small private university in southern Illinois, where I'm majoring in History and English Literature. My dream job would be that of a local historian, with a focus on Mississippi River culture, but I see myself pursuing a job as an archivist or something related to historic preservation. I've also considered being a professor, but all of this is very new to me because, until my second month of college, the plan since I was 14 was to become a politician at the state level, but now I've decided to follow what makes me happy, rather than what I thought would make me satisfied, (there's a big difference).",Contributor,,,2007-11-01,0,0,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pie.png,2332

Otherwise, it's something I've found here. I'm famous for following directions on great recipes. Fave restaurant - Lula Cafe. Right on the Square in Logan Square. Everything I've had there is amazing. They change their menu weekly to adjust with the freshest/most local ingredients. It's really fantastic. I know I don't know you, but you should go.

201354,454692,https://www.food.com/user/454692,chocolatelover,"I've been married to the love of my life for 14 years. I'm mom to an adorable, energetic, spirited 2 year old boy. ""What I'm just eating my jelly sandwich?"" Work: I have been a nanny/child care provider for the same family for 10 years. They now have 3 children 10, 7, 4. I work 24 hr a week. What I am passionate about: God, my family, friends, scrapbooking, christian music and books. Play: I love playing with my son. It's fun teaching him ABC's, numbers, colors, animals, singing, doodling... He amazes me daily. (He can count to 30 by himself) He knows his letter& the sounds they make (thanks to Leap Frog Letter Factory video highly reccommend) He goes around singing the A says Ah the B says Ba! He's hilarious! My husband and I enjoy going to St. Louis for Blues hockey games. Mommy time: Twice a month I enjoy a mom's group, MOPS (Mothers of Pre Schoolers.) They are an amazing group that exists to encourage, equip and develop every mother of preschoolers to realize her potential as a woman, mother and leader in the name of Jesus Christ. It is so refreshing to get out and have conversations with mom's who have been throught or are going through the same mothering challenges. We have food, fellowship, discussion groups, speakers, do crafts, sometimes play a game. My friends and I get together one Friday night a month and scrapbook from 6pm-midnight. Oh what fun! Meals: A neighbor and I do a meal swap where we each cook 1 night a week for (our own and) the other's family. It's so nice to have a night off from cooking and to try foods I may not normally fix. Favorite cookbook: Any Gooseberry Patch. Favorite cooking magazine: Cooks Country Cooking: I am trying to adapt my cooking from convience foods to more home cooked meals. Pet Peeves: People who talk all about themselves and don't ask any questions to get to know others.(You can never have too many friends)",Contributor,,,2007-02-01,1,0,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pie.png,2904

I love and admire the craftsmanship and the love that the best chefs represent, and I humbly experiment in my own kitchen. Little by little my taste-buds has matured and I’m beginning to develop a genuine interest in wine, cheese, fish and numerous other delicacies, and I often find myself thinking about composing interesting and surprising menus. I often experiment with different cooking techniques and flavors -constantly trying to up my skills. However you should remember that 80% of the result derrives from the ingredients you use.

I like meals during the week that don't take longer than 1 hour from stove to table. I work for Fedex and have been for 22 years now.

Cooking fits right into a creative passion in life, if I have the time. My biggest pet peeve in life is eating food that is not served hot all at the same time. Or ordering food in a restaurant and they don't get the fries hot and fresh. Duh! the easiest thing in the world to cook. If I had a month off, I would refinish furniture, do stained glass, paint, eat. :)",Contributor,,"Fargo, North Dakota",2004-03-01,0,0,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pasta.png,4265
