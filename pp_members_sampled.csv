I can't stop eating it, and I've eaten myself into a food coma. 4 Stars The recipe is wonderful as is. I can't think of a single improvement and I will most likely make it again. 3 Stars This needed a little *something*something*. I might make it again, but will add my own improvements if I do.

As for my cooking philosophy, I like easy things that might take a long time to cook, but only need occasional tending (like bread or dals). Lately, I've been very interested in healthy substitutions to make dishes with less fat and/or more fiber. I've been experimenting with making tasty recipes that are free of processed sugars and flour. Since moving to China, I've found myself without an oven and without access to common ingredients, like Bisquick and vanilla ext., so I'm currently looking for breads or cakes that I can cook in a crockpot.

We have 22 acres outside several small farming/ranching/oil communities, with 1-1/2 acre pond, 5 big dogs that swim the waters (and 1 who's old and sleeps all day inside), and a mama doe who has a set of twins each year. I'm a movie enthusiast and my passion is writing (novels and screenplays). Over the past 2 years I've picked up painting and love it. When my kids are out of college in 6 years, my husband and I plan to travel extensively. I'd love to relocate temporarily to different ares of the USA and world, just so I can absorb the culture (and write about them). My whole life has been centered around food to show love and to socialize, so when I travel I'll search for the best foods and absorb the richness of the people. In the book Beach Music by Pat Conroy, you can taste the foods and drinks of the piazzas in Rome down to the detail of the Southern cuisine in S. Carolina. When I grow up, I want to write as beautifully as Mr. Conroy. My favorite cookbooks are those put together as church or other fundraisers. There's nothing better than a church potluck dinner, so you're almost gauranteed excellent recipes. I love cooking but hate the clean up, so my plans are when I earn the publishing $$big bucks$$, I'll hire a full-time housekeeper so I may cook to my heart's delight and not get frustrated over a messy kitchen. I love experimenting and trying new recipes, but my DH is a meat & potatoes man, thus prefers the basics. One of my children has been a self-professed vegetarian for 11 years, making dinner time a real treat to prepare. I've read somewhere that your pet peeve is usually something of which you're frequently guilty, so I'm a little hesitant to say; however, mine would be inconsiderate people.

I've tried to keep the best of them (and often the more unusual) and look forward to sharing them with you, here. I am proud to say that I have several family members who are also on RecipeZaar! My husband, here as Steingrim, is an excellent cook. He rarely uses recipes, though, so often after he's made dinner I sit down at the computer and talk him through how he made the dishes so that I can get it down on paper. Some of these recipes are in his account, some of them in mine - he rarely uses his account, though, so we'll probably usually post them to mine in the future. My sister Cathy is here as cxstitcher and my mom is Juliesmom - say hi to them, eh? Our friend Darrell is here as Uncle Dobo, too! I've been typing in his recipes for him and entering them on R'Zaar. We're hoping that his sisters will soon show up with their own accounts, as well. :) I collect cookbooks (to slow myself down I've limited myself to purchasing them at thrift stores, although I occasionally buy an especially good one at full price), and - yes, I admit it - I love FoodTV. My favorite chefs on the Food Network are Alton Brown, Rachel Ray, Mario Batali, and Giada De Laurentiis. I'm not fond over fakey, over-enthusiastic performance chefs... Emeril drives me up the wall. I appreciate honesty. Of non-celebrity chefs, I've gotta say that that the greatest influences on my cooking have been my mother, Julia Child, and my cooking instructor Chef Gabriel Claycamp at Seattle's Culinary Communion. In the last couple of years I've been typing up all the recipes my grandparents and my mother collected over the years, and am posting them here. Some of them are quite nostalgic and are higher in fat and processed ingredients than recipes I normally collect, but it's really neat to see the different kinds of foods they were interested in... to see them either typewritten oh-so-carefully by my grandfather, in my grandmother's spidery handwriting, or - in some cases - written by my mother years ago in fountain pen ink. It's like time travel. Cooking peeve: food/cooking snobbery.

84479,76951,https://www.food.com/user/76951,Claudia Dawn,"I live in Northern Indiana with my husband of 37 years and best friend, Evan. Due to unfortunate circumstances and God's grace, we are raising our two beautiful grandchildren from our daughter, Chris, who lost her battle with breast cancer after a hard, four year battle. It is a responsibility that I do not take lightly. God has blessed us with these kids and it is an honor to be able to raise them. That's not to say, it's easy. Organization is the key. We do lots of meal planning and advance preparation. Evan & I enjoy eating out at fine restaurants and then trying to re-create gourmet meals at home. Unfortunately (?) we are such good cooks that we are usually disappointed when eating out because we know that what we prepare tastes better (and less expensive). Therefore, we usually only order something that we haven't made at home. We love to cook together and spend many hours cooking for family and friends. Quite honestly, Evan is the better cook in the family. He has a knack for knowing what flavors and spices blend well together and has created many original creations. I love to find and try out new recipes - which is why I visit Recipezaar often. We've added many of your shared recipes to my public cookbook titled Permanent Edition. I only post recipes that are our favorites and feel that others will enjoy them. I look for ease of preparation AND outstanding flavor. If I post a recipe that's a little more work, it's because the end result deserves the extra effort. If we had a month off with no work, no responsibilities, and no financial issues; we'd spent time on the ocean in Oregon. My husband grew up in Seattle and spent summers at Cannon Beach (Oregon). I've only been there twice but absolutely love the area. src=http://i23.photobucket.com/albums/b399/susied214/permanent%20collection/PACfall08partic.jpg border=0 alt=Photobucket>",Contributor,4.7,"Goshen, IN",2003-03-01,4,52,"http://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/h_120,w_160,c_fill,q_92/v1//pickle_media1/media/rz_migration/76/Photo_Video_76951_medthumb_hor.jpg",119

That's his photo as my icon. Oh, and a new kitten that the kids named ""KeeKee"" but who I call Little Kitteh. I love them with all my heart! Even though I don't have my parents anymore, their presence is always felt and their love has resonated in my life, even after all this time. You'll find a lot of my posted recipes that refer to ""Jolean"" --- and that's my Mom. :) I sure do miss her... I love music, especially 70's music, cats, incense & lavalights, candles, and I love to play guitar. I've been called an old ""hippie chick,"" and I don't mind that label in the least. I also love to try other people's recipes and find ones that remind me of my Mother, and those precious memories that I had growing up in a household with such a wonderfully comforting cook...I work full-time in a real estate office as an office administrator. I came to this site looking for recipes that were tried and true. I stayed at this site because I found people who were kind, loving, caring and shared the same interest that I do --- food and cooking. I've saved a lifetime of recipes and learned so much about cooking and ingredients that I actually feel proud of my cooking. I bet my Mom looks down on me with pride every time I cook a new recipe from RecipeZaar, and I bet my Dad cracks up every time he sees me photographing what I've cooked! My daughters have actually gotten into the act, too, and are quite versed in searching for recipes and answers here on Zaar. Makes me proud to be their Mom. RecipeZaar isn't just a ""website."" It's a lifestyle. And some of the friends I've made here are LIFELONG friends to me --- and in my estimation, those types of people are a rare thing to find in this world. :) P.S.

Also, if you make changes or substitutions, I'd love to see your suggestions and/or comments, but I'd appreciate no rating at all if it's not made as posted. Too many recipe reviews state margarine subbed for butter (if I list butter, it's REAL butter), different spices, low-fat ingredients, whole wheat flour instead of white, etc. The recipes will not work/taste as intended, so it's really not fair to rate them as such. I'd also really appreciate it if you refrain from rating a recipe if you overcook or overbake it or it you don't refrigerate or store as listed. I, of course, will adhere to the above when rating recipes, too! Thanks and have a great day! My Rating System: ***** A delicious recipe that was thoroughly enjoyed. It has excellent, detailed directions and is perfect as is. If a dish is especially easy, and I'm on the fence, I will give it 5* for ease even if it's very good instead of great. Something I will definitely make again. **** Excellent recipe but confusing directions that I will make again in my own less confusing way OR Very good recipe that I'll probably make again if I find the time! *** Good/OK recipe but probably not something I would make again OR Very Good recipe that doesn't have clear, detailed directions. ** Recipe was edible but not really enjoyed and will not be made again. Work involved not a good trade-off for the end result. * Not edible and probably an error in the recipe. I feel that I pick recipes with ingredients our family likes, so in my opinion, there's an error somewhere. If there's a chance I made the error, I won't rate the recipe. ;)",Contributor,4.6,"Sharon Hill, 0",2002-04-01,1,361,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/drink.png,52

Now I post all recipes I've tried or would like to try. I'm actually making it my goal to try almost all the recipes I've posted as soon as I can. I love food and I love to eat and try different recipes. My favorite course is dessert. I love sweets! This leads me to that I did have Gastric Bypass surgery on July 25th 2008. On that note I love baking and cooking a priceless gift passed down from my grammy who I dearly loved and miss deeply. My grammy passed away 1/15/07. She was a wonderful cook and baker and taught me many things and the most valueable things was how to be a wonderful cook and baker like her. I really enjoy searching for new recipes especially here on Zaar. I'm always finding and adding to my cookbook new and exciting recipes. I also enjoy posting recipes here on Zaar as well. I really love collecting different cookbooks. I have over a 100 and growing! I collect mostly Taste Of Home & community cookbooks. The minute I get a cookbook home I sit down and I read my cookbooks from front to back like novels. I work for the Elmira City School District and YWCA. I'm raising my 8 yrs old newphew. I'm a part time college student studing Early Childhood Education, but taking time off and hoping to return soon.

I collect other cookbooks that look intresting or have healthy dishes. My collection is modest, but I love it. Also, I love the Taste of Home magazines. They have real food that real people cook. I would have to say my pet peeves are people who drive while talking on cell phones and people who cannot spell potato. It is p o t a t o not p o t a t o e. There is no e unless you are spelling the plural form of potato which is potatoes. I frequently see that word mispelled in recipes and it makes me think the recipe is somehow devalued because of the spellings. The Zaar system of ratings works for me. I do try to explain myself in my reviews and welcome any questions or comments on what I have said. It is not my intention to be mean-spirited if I did not like something (it is rare for me not to like a recipe though):) Recipezaar brings such a nice element to my life and I feel it has been enriched by the wealth of knowledge both in everyone's contributed recipes and on the forums.

We're lucky enough to own a home with a big, south facing yard which is great for entertaining. It also allows me to have a big vegetable garden where I grow most of my own herbs and a lot of the vegetables we eat in the summer, as well as a bunch to share with family and friends. In my professional life, I'm an accountant- but what I really love to do is cook and eat! Most of my ability is self-taught. I love to experiment with new recipes and techniques, most of which I get from watching way too much food tv and reading foodie magazines. Recently I decided to start a personal chef business and have cooked for a few clients. I love the challenge of designing a menu to fit a family's specific tastes and needs, and then cooking it for them to enjoy. For me, cooking is an expression of love. Everyone needs to eat, but food is more than just fuel for the body, it can nurture and comfort ~ give us a memory from childhood, or a retreat when we feel ill. I always think of the people who I'm cooking for when I make a dish, and there is no better compliment than when someone enjoys the food I've made especially for them. I also like to do OAMC- style cooking, but instead of using it mainly to get dinner on the table, I focus on getting lunch in the bag! Eating out is far too expensive in both dollars and nutrition to make a habit of, yet I want a hot, satisfying meal to enjoy in the middle of the day. Cookin ahead allows me to have great food, without sacrificing either my dollars or my waistline.

I was on a forced hiatus from the UofM, due to illness. From there my sister, mother and I went to NYC to work and my father went to Haiti in Port-Au-Prince, where he and my uncle had purchased some tiny cocoa plantations & a chocolate factory - for the choccolate liquer - to make baking chocolate (the real bitter stuff). We joined my father about 2 months later where I spent 2 of the most carefree & wonderful years of my life! It is the stuff that movies are made of! (A la Grace Kelly - even my clothes were like hers)>  I then continued my studies in upstate NY and hated it because it was too, too cold!:( Went back to NYC to work and see what I wanted to do with my life - I was all of 20 years old and had to drop out of school because of illness and then because of the weather! Yuck - so I got a job in a Textile Buying Office as a receptionist and soon I found myself buying trimmings! Loved it and was very happy with the work I was doing. However, I got an offer from two young guys who had a factory in Cleveland, Ohio, where they made Maternity Clothes and they wanted me to be in charge of the shipping dept, keep inventory and in my spare time - help with the designing!! I couldn't pass it up - the offer sounded so great and the salary was twice what I was making in the NYC. So I went to Cleveland, got married, had both my children and got a divorce 15 years later. Then my children and I moved to South Florida and have been here since 1978, I can't count that far back :) Learned how to do taxes with H&R Block and worked simultaneously as a Supervisor in 2 offices for them for 15 years. Then after the accident everything went spiralling downwards until I could no longer walk alone even with a walker - so the next step was a wheelchair. Stayed at home with a lot of help (nurses, PT therapists) fixed the bathroom so I could bathe myself and fixed the kitchen so I could help warm-up meals (was taught how to cook in rehab) and so forth and so on. However, the fire department had other plans for me, I called them too often to pick me up off the floor - how embarassing! So they gave me a choice - either a home or they would have to call HRS! :( (very sad) It was there, in my home where I was robbed!  All my cookbooks (all my Julia Childs Cookbooks, my Settlement Cookbook which had been my mothers - published in 1939 - with all her notes) my mother's cookbooks from Cuba & Haiti, all my handwritten recipes. They also took all my Delft collection, some antiques that I had in the kitchen like my rolling pin, a beautiful old & used wooden bowl, a charcoal-iron that was brought north when my parents left Haiti, it was hand-painted & was gorgeous, as well as all the other things that are too numerous to mention! That proved to be the last straw & from there it was an ALF, which was horrible, and then on to another home where the administrator of that home became the administrator here and voila, here I am. I have a beautiful large private room with a private bath, furnished to my liking: eclectic!  My room is large enough to house my office and all the other odds and ends with which I like to surround myself. During tax season, mostly, my room is always full (of course I love it that way)! I have a blanket my daughter bought for me in New Mexico and that is on my bed. You guessed it - that is where everbody sits or on my great grandfather's arm chair which is in great shape.  Update 01/11/2008 that time is here again :) Have started doing taxes already and not just regular taxes but corporations, partnerships and 1040X - ammended returns! Whoopee! I love the feeling I get when this time comes around and I get into gear!!! I love it! :) The head chef, the kitchen supervisor & the dietician enjoy the recipes from Zaar; the ones that I post, as well as, the others. We are in the process of changing the menu right now - so we have been doing a lot of figuring. The administrator is so cute because every once in a while she asks for a recipe and then she gives me a pack of paper so I can print them. I am president of the resident council and most of the family members come to me to take care of their grievances - this way I do my part - and the staff can take care of the larger problems! It has been working for 10 years - why change if it ain't broke? Well, it's time to say hasta luego folks.",Contributor,4.6,,2005-07-01,6,78,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pop.png,2487

Once again I found myself on Zaar as it came to be called. Over the years I hung out and learned from some of the best home cooks in the country, I posted over 700 recipes on the site, reviewed over 3500 recipes and posted over 3000 food photos. Over the next 10 years the site made many changes and in 2010 it was sold to to Food Network and became Food.com. Until last year we played games, talked and shared with one another. As a result of the community and the relationships I built I got to meet some wonderful people from all over the country. I also have a great number of friends that I have never meet face to face.

84682,29196,https://www.food.com/user/29196,JustJanS,"Thanks for visiting my page and thanks too to any of you who take the time to make, review or photograph one of my recipes. I came to Recipezaar 9 years ago looking for a duck salad recipe. Bergy answered my request, I took a look around the site and joined that day (January 18th 2002). I can't remember my life without Recipezaar. I've made (and met) many wonderful friends through it. In 2005, I was invited to host the brand new Australian/New Zealand forum, but quit that role recently and am really enjoying just being a Groupie! I am married to Russell. He was a widower with 3 teenage boys and I was a single parent with two little boys when we met in Feb 1992. We now have 5 wonderful grown men (my baby is 26), 5 beautiful partners (we finally got the girls) 2 special grandsons, and count ourselves so lucky. The night Russ and I met, we stayed up until 6am talking about food and wine and 18 years later, we are still doing it!  This mutal love of food lead to a huge weight gain for both of us (both around 110kgs) so at the end of March 2010, I  decided enough is enough and  embarked on my own weight loss program. We've reduced fat intake and protein portions, upped fibre (so lots of fresh fish, veg, salads and a bit more fruit), reduced alcohol and stopped snacking (unless it's a piece of fruit or a pickled onion or cucumber). I have lost 33 kg (or around 72 lbs) to date (August 2011)and  I've gone from an Aus size 24 (US 20) to my current 14/16 (US 10/12) I'd like to lose a futher 8 kgs, but one step at a time! Russ  has lost 38 kg so is the lightest he's been since arriving in Australia 32 years ago! I  get a shock these days when I do the laundry cos his clothes are so SMALL!!! People often say they are amazed because losing weight is so hard but I'm amazed at how easy this is. And so much nicer than the alternative I was looking at-lap banding! I can go out and eat and drink as I wish, then come home and be sensible. It's certainly working for us! I can walk, get up and down off the floor or ground, and I now buy clothes  because I like them, not just because they fit!). My blood pressure has gone from dangerous to perfect, my cholesterol and blood sugars are perfect and way back into normal now so it's been really good from a health aspect too. For every day this has taken, I feel like I've been given back two-my life has changed so much with the things I now feel I can do. I even managed to walk almost 11ks around the big red rock Uluru in the top picture and I know I couldn't have done it 12 months before. My eventual aim is to ride on the FRONT of the camel-recently, I had to ride on the back as I'm heavier than Russ lol. But twelve months ago I couldn't ride at all as I was out of the weight range to do so! Once upon a time, I used to be a chef, cooking for a living, but now just really enjoy cooking for the two of us, family and friends. I think that my food knowledge has really helped in our weight loss though. The middle photo was at my starting weight of 110kg taken in Feb 2010 and the bottom taken January 2011 and 24kg lighter, the TOP taken in April 2011 and 27kgs lighter!  I can see the difference even if you can't LOL. I wish I knew how to edit them into order. Russ and I still love our food-we wake up thinking about dinner and go to sleep remembering it. I especially like light, bright Asian food and if it has duck in it, that's an added bonus. We are keen fisher people and keep ourselves well supplied with fresh fish, squid, crabs and fresh yabbies (crawfish). In February 2006 we headed off on what was to be  3 years and two months travelling Australia. It was the most wonderful time of our lives but all things must end and in May 2009, we moved into a brand new villa unit. I  realised then how much I had missed my own laundry room, kitchen and sofa (all things I took for granted until we travelled in our caravan).  Since coming home, we've spent the winters travelling and fishing in the warm northerly parts of Australia and the summers in our gorgeous little home amongst friends and family. It's a wonderful life and I feel so very privilaged to be able to experience it! When we leave home to travel, we take along all the food in our pantry, carry a domestic freezer, vacuum sealer, all our knives and favourite cookware and eat exactly the same as we would at home (perhaps we eat more fresh seafood)-we aren't on vacation-we're just living somewhere else! Why did I give you the stars that I gave you??? 5 stars=awsome, fantastic, amazing, nothing to complain about 4 stars=very good, but I added something, felt it needed something, the recipe wasn't particularly well written or it really wasn't awesome, fantastic or amazing, just very good 3 stars=it was OK 2 stars=it was forgetable 1 star=no one could/would eat it tonight, tomorrow or ever again",Contributor,4.7,224,2002-01-01,2,181,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pie.png,727

I subscribe to several cooking magazines, that usually, require everyday on-hand ingredients. I am not very fond of most seafood, but do enjoy lobster, grilled shrimp and chilean sea bass. I won't cook anything with rosemary or curry, as I really don't like either herbs' flavor. And now from trying recipes, I found that I don't like dijon mustard, but love vinegar and mustard, not sure why I don't like the taste of dijon mustard.

I have friends from all over the world, my best friend is canadian and also lived in france, so her mum and her for that fact, are mean chefs, boy do i like going to her house. I recently found out I am intollerant to wheat so have found it difficult to give up such easy foods to find and now have to search harder. I also have 2 leaks in my heart, one on a valve going in and one on a valve going out. A top carteoligist from London told me as long as I don't get pregnant for a while (I should hope not, I'm only 15) or eat fatty foods, my heart would do allright. He said he didn't want to operate on me yet, beacause there is a operation coming in the next 10 years which is lazer, so he wants me to wait, but he said I was fit and healthy and had no need to worry, yet....... when i was younger i dreamed of being a choreographer or a marine biolagist, then i wanted to work for vouge magazine, then get married and move to barbados and raise a family where the only thing that passes anyones lips will be home grown or hand made, a bit ambitious i know, hehe. But now my dream is to be a laywer and help others that really need it, and hopefully move back to my roots and bring up a family there For lent i have given up refined sugars and it is so hard and i am only 3 days into it, i was starving at school, opened my tuk box only to find marshmallows and smarties and a box of cereal, i think cereal is about to become my best friend over the next 6 weeks. LOL EDITED 30TH AUGUST; Last night at 3:30am, my best friend lost her battle to cancer and it has made me realise how important it is to live life to the full and take every opportunity thrown at us. She was a special girl and only 15 - wherever she is now though, she is out of her suffering. I have no doubt that she went straight to heaven. Lord rest your soul. i also have a lot of favourite sayings, here are some of them ""shoot for the moon, even if you don't make it, you'll land amoung the stars"" ""I'm on a seafood diet, see food and eat it"" ""smiling is infectious, you catch it like the flu, when someone smiled at me today, i started smiling too, i passed around the corner and someone saw me grin, when he smiled i realised, i'd passed it on to him. I thought about that smile, then i realised it's worth, a single smile just like mine could pass around the earth. So if you feel a smile begin, don't leave undetected.

84750,144490,https://www.food.com/user/144490,Kitchen Witch Steph,"A picture of me and my dear friend Liz. I'm on the left. I live in Blacksburg, Virginia with my husband and 3 young children, and one fat cat. I'm a stay at home Mom of an 8 year old girl, 5 year old boy, and 2 year old girl. They are all stinky rotten but I am terribly attached to them. Plus, they do put up with me. I guess I'll keep them. Dinner preparation can be challenging with my toddler hanging on my leg but I still try to make a really nice meal. I enjoy cooking so much and though I could turn to more convenience foods to help me out, I just don't like to. My food is a source of pride for me. Some of my best memories are of my Mom in the kitchen. So, let the laundry pile up and the dust accumulate because I am spending my time in the kitchen. I live in a close knit community and have an excellent support network of other Moms. There are a lot of good cooks in the bunch so there is a lot of recipe swapping. My MOPS group just sent a cookbook to the printer to make it back by the holidays. I helped with the editing. Blacksburg may be small but the presence of Virginia Tech ensures that we have a constant ebb and flow of folks from all over the place. Small town meets global world. I'm originally from Indiana where I was raised to love basketball but have transitioned over to Hokie football. Sometimes our town IS that football team. Certainly, I love the tailgating and I feel at home among the ever present sea of orange and maroon. I love this place. If I am eating out in Blacksburg, I'm most likely to be seen at Gillies's for breakfast, Cabo Fish Taco for lunch, and the Cellar for dinner. RecipeZaar is the cooking site I visit most. I can almost always find what I am looking for here. The reviews and ratings are so helpful. The folks here seldom let me down. I have accumulated quite a recipe collection from you all. Thank you! I find myself in the natural foods section of the grocery more and more these days. I have been gradually weaning the family off of processed foods. I can't fathom becoming a vegetarian anytime soon so we buy organic beef from a local farmer. It's great stuff and we get it at a good price. I've been cooking with whole grains and fresh produce more often lately. I am trying my hand at making my own mayo and ketchup. I went in with a friend to purchase a grain mill to mill our own grains into flour. I look forward to gaining more experience in bread making. Want to try grain soaking. My favorite cookbooks are my old Fanny Farmer and Good Housekeeping, a 1990 edition of the NY Times cookbook, and an Amish cookbook by Marcia Adams. I still love my sweets. I tell myself that if I make it from scratch and I use more organic and raw ingredients, that it's OK. Not exactly healthy but an improvement. I do find that many of the desserts I used to like are just too sweet for me anymore. This has put me on a quest to update or replace some of the recipes I've had for a long time. Other interests of mine include children's literature, cardmaking, writing, afternoon naps. the art of Charles Harper & Audrey Kawasaki, craftsman houses, and tournament-style Scrabble. Autumn is my favorite season. Few things please me more than the fall's crisp air, leaves dancing around in a cascade of colors, and my glorious friends the pumpkins. The Blue Ridge Mountains are perfect. Plenty of trails locally and in the mountains to do lots of nature walks.",Contributor,4.7,"Blacksburg, VA",2004-06-01,10,23,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/fruit-kebab.png,1582

84757,95743,https://www.food.com/user/95743,sugarpea,"I’m a former interior designer and landscape designer. At the moment I get to enjoy being at home and working only when I want to. I like rollerblading, hiking, backpacking and trips to the ocean. I grew up on a farm in the Midwest and moved to the Northwest when I was thirty, over twenty years ago. I’m afraid they’ll have to bury me here in WA. This is God’s country and I’m never leaving. I have a smallish collection of cookbooks, preferring to use the library and a copy machine. Among my favorites though, are: Recipes 1-2-3, by Rozanne Gold, a collection of recipes containing no more than 3 ingredients (excepting water, salt and pepper); A Treasury of Great Recipes, by Mary and Vincent Price, recipes collected from friends and chefs of great restaurants around the world; The Mediterranean Diet Cookbook, by Nancy Harmon Jenkins, about a collection of cuisines I’m convinced are the healthiest in the world and The Low-Calorie Gourmet, by Pierre Franey. Currently my passions are our dogs, the garden, cooking, the natural world and of course, Dh. I can now add Zaar to that list of passions (translate: addiction). We have three dogs, two rescued and one adopted. They are Sugarpea, a Golden Retriever, Chickpea, a Llasa Apso and Sweetpea, a Shih Tzu; small, medium and large. We’re quite a sight out on the trail. One of the things I am most fond of about living here is the ability to vegetable garden year ‘round.",Contributor,4.6,"Snohomish, WA",2003-07-01,1,34,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/taco.png,103
84759,327600,https://www.food.com/user/327600,Swan Valley Tammi,"I live in beautiful western Manitoba, Canada. I'm a wife and stay-at-home mom with 2 daughters, Peanut (who turned 7 at the end of January) and Fidget (who will turn 5 in the middle of June) and a husband whom I call The Bushman, who's motto, lucky for me, is I'll try anything once! I'm a Mennonite by heritage as well as faith. I'm a born again Christian and we belong to a small Evangelical Mennonite country church where The Bushman and I are fairly involved. The church is made up largely of family groups -- most are related somehow. That's actually a Mennonite pastime, finding out how everyone's related to each other. If we're not directly related, we'll find a connection somehow -- your third cousin's wife's brother is for SURE my mother's father's sister-in-law's nephew!! See, isn't it amazing how small this world really is?! For fun, I enjoy photography -- my favourite subjects are sunsets, cloud formations, my girls, and nature close-ups -- reading, (John Grisham, Frederick Forsythe, Robert Ludlum, and Clive Cussler are my favourite authors), playing piano, and going for nice long walks, either first thing in the morning or towards sunset. I've even learned to enjoy it in the dead of winter, when I have no choice but to walk in semi-darkness. For those of you who've never experienced a Manitoba winter (lucky you!), 'the dead of winter' includes pretty much all of December, January, and February!! And up here, our shortest days of the year have only 7 hours of daylight, so if it's cloudy, well, it feels like no daylight at all! It's my favourite time to plan my day, pray, and daydream about what might happen if I'd ever actually buy a lottery ticket and win!! I love cooking -- baking not so much (mostly because it's not essential to survival and if there's baking in the house, that's all we eat!!) -- and reading recipe books is a favourite pastime of mine. I love the Company's Coming series of cookbooks, but my favourite is Taste of Home magazine. Since buying a premium membership here though, I've decided to let my subscription run out. I'll miss it, but I've decided there's really no need for it, since all the best recipes in the world eventually end up here!!",Contributor,4.6,,2006-06-01,5,25,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/burger.png,2296

84763,357272,https://www.food.com/user/357272,the_cookie_lady,"***09-02-2007 UPDATE*** I will soon be moving again. Finally, I will be out on my own. Just imagine what culinary adventures I will embark on then! I also have been admitted into the baking program at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa, California and am also attending my first semester at California State University, Fullerton. I have two years left before I can get my BA in English and one more year following that before I have my teaching credentials. Then I will be off to teach high school English while I wait to gather the needed money and experience to open my own dream bakery! ***02-08-2007 UPDATE*** I went out looking for a job and, on the first application I turned in, the lady interviewed me right on the spot and gave me the job. I am now an ICING MAKER!!!! I make the icing for the cookie bouquets that can be found on www.cookiesbydesign.com . She has also since taught me to bake the cookies, as well as how to process the sales and assembly of the cookie bouquets. All I have left to learn is how to decorate them (although I have already done some lettering on the message cookies). ***02-02-2007 UPDATE*** I now live with one of my good friends from back in high school. Her family offered to help me out by letting me live with them while I attend college down in Southern California. I just transfered down here with intent to start at the California State University of Fullerton in the fall. Getting a computer to work around here is a toughie, so I won't be able to post or message as often as I was when I lived with my grandparents. I'll do my best, though! I LOVE to bake! I would really like to have a bakery someday. I don't get to try out as many recipes as I used to now that I live with a friend from high school and her family. Food Network is about the only TV I watch anymore and I have a growing cookbook collection. Cooking is my comfort and, surprisingly enough, I've found that I eat FAR less when I make it myself. Thats TWO great benefits! I seem to have a little obsession, though, with collecting cookbooks. I guess it is getting pretty bad when I have to sneak new cookbooks into the house and hide them in the towel closet in my bathroom so my grandma doesn't see them and tell me I'm crazy for bringing another cookbook home. I buy all my cookbooks at thrift stores, garage sales, library sales, etc. I especially love old cookbooks and cookbooks from church, school, or charity groups. A lot of the recipes I submit are recipes from my many cookbooks that I haven't tried yet. Since most of my cookbooks are in storage right now, I need to get rid of as many of these cookbooks as I can. I plan to save the recipes I want before donating the cookbooks back to the library. My obligatory chunkett (that's probably not a word, but I use it ALL the time) about my other half because I love him so much: My boyfriend now lives about 20 minutes away from me since I moved back down to Southern California. Before my move, we were about 5-6 hours apart (I still can't believe we went through that for over a year!). We have been friends for years but lost touch during the 4 years that he went to college. He graduated June 2005 and we got back in touch that July. We have been dating since December 2, 2005 and are a pretty idyllic match thus far. He is one of my best friends. He gave me a promise ring 4-8-06 and we do plan to get married. The only thing holding us back is my dad's single wish that I graduate college before I get married. This is the only guy he has ever liked that I have dated, so I figure a few more years isn't that long to wait. Life would be so very different if something happened and he were to be taken away from me..... Anyway, onward ho! Gosh, I love food!",Contributor,4.4,,2006-09-01,11,7,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/burger.png,5032

I love to cook and experiment with new recipes. I've been collecting cookbooks (I have a few hundred) and recipes for as long as I can remember. I like to buy recipe boxes at yard sales and auctions and peak through them for yummy recipe gems. I've found some really amazing recipes that way. I'm a huge fan of Le Creuset enameled cast iron cookware. I've been collecting different pieces for a few years now. I always considered myself a great cook but these pans raise things to a whole new level. I'm planning to post all of my favorite recipes that I've collected over the years. I have all these clippings and pieces of paper and magazine clips that are everywhere. My recipe boxes are packed with these things and it's time to organize the whole mess. I suppose it will take years (did I say years?!?) to get them all posted but it's worth it. So keep checking back to my posts for new goodies. I can't wait to see what long lost gems turn up. I've already run across several of my old favs. Isn't it nice to have all your best recipes all organized right here? I've also been printing them out and putting them in a nice new binder where I can actually find them when I want to make them. I LOVE this site. I have found some of the best recipes EVER right here on 'Zaar. There are some fantastic cooks here and I just want to say ""Thank you"" to all of you who have made me look like the greatest cook on the planet with your wonderful recipes. I try to make as many new ones each week as I can. It's so much fun experimenting. My DH of 9 years is my guinea pig- he will eat ANYTHING I put in front of him. My little girl... well, she's more of a challenge to please. Not really picky but she doesn't really like meat or stuffing or peppers or mushrooms or.... oh, the new one is onions. I could go on but you get the idea. You probably have or had one just like her. They seem to learn all about these things that they don't like at school. All of the sudden...they don't like something they've been eating for 3 years because their friend ""Alyssa"" doesn't like it. What a challenge it is feeding these little creatures!

I have enjoyed cooking and baking since I was first able to peer over the top of Mom’s kitchen counter. I have been married for over 25 years and have one adult daughter. My hobbies (other than cooking) include gardening, yoga, shopping, reading, and crafts. I also have a commitment to myself to work out for an hour at least 3 times a week Every other weekend, DH and I go to our weekend home at a golf course country club. On Friday afternoons, we usually eat lunch on the road as we try to beat the traffic out of town. I'm always looking for new sandwich ideas for those Friday lunches. Once we get there, I don't want to drive yet again to the supermarket or even out to dinner. (The closest supermarket is 3 miles away.) Through 'zaar, I have found the convenience of ""dump"" recipes for Friday night dinners. I make them up in advance and freeze, then just put them in the ice chest for the trip. They are ready to grill or bake for dinner. During the week, I stick with quick and easy recipes that can be prepared in 45 minutes or less. On weekends is when I try the more complicated recipes that take a longer time to prepare. I've assembled by main dish cookbooks accordingly. I have nothing against convenience foods (use them all the time!) and I am in no way a food snob. However, I don't cook with cream of xxxx soups, processed cheese food, and others of that ilk. Besides being full of sodium, fat and other bad things, I just don't care for the taste and texture. DH is lactose-intolerant and has high cholesterol, which challenges me to find healthy good-tasting recipes.",Contributor,4.4,United States,2004-02-01,0,20,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pie.png,133

I feel very privileged to be one of the hosts on the Photo Forum. Taking photos of my culinary efforts is a full time hobby and I love it. My friends all know what to expect when they come to dinner ""Are you finished taking pictures?"" or ""Did you get a photo of so & so?"" I never let them wait too long and the food is NEVER cold! I now have over 6000 photos on Zaar - some fairly good and some definitely not so good. I am happy to say that practice does help. My roots are in Vancouver BC Canada - a very beautiful city that holds many wonderful memories for me. In 1990, I decided that for my retirement years I may want to settle in a smaller community and found a slice of heaven in the North Okanagan B.C. I love living here but every once in a while I miss the bright city lights, the Broadway shows and some of the small wonderful ethnic restaurants that Vancouver abounds in. That is easily resolved. I just take a trip to the coast, visit with friends for a weekend see a show and feast on Dim Sum or other specialty foods. I am getting a bit long in the tooth but was a very adventurous person. I have river rafted Hell's Gate on the Fraser river, been up in a glider over Hawaii (no not a Hang Glider!), gone hot air ballooning in the Napa Valley & the Fraser Valley, driven dune buggies on the dunes in Oregon, Para sailing in Mexico and tried many other adventurous, challenging, fun things. I have yet to try bungee jumping or sky diving. I may do them yet. I love to travel and experience other cultures. Mexco has been a favorite haunt. I have visited that lovely country many many times. Australia is another favorite as is England! In the past 16 months I have taken off 61 pounds and feel wonderful. I am off all medications and all systems are GO! In years I may be 79 but in spirit I am still in my forties. We are only as old as we allow ourselves to feel. Always think positive. Do something a bit challenging every day & always do something silly every day. Be a kid again! Laugh every day - it is internal jogging.

DH and I live about 40 miles north of Baltimore, in what WAS rural 40 years ago. We are empty-nesters. Have 2 adult daughters, 2 great SIL, and 3 grandchildren --1 is 22, and 16 year old twins. In September of 2011, we were presented with our first GREAT-grandson !  They all live in PA. and are VERY busy people ! I retired from MANY facets of nursing 12 years ago, and LOVE being in charge of myself ! We had a 4-couple Gourmet Group for so many years, that we ran out of new things and themes. Now we meet at restaurants, to avoid trashing the kitchen as well as the budget. We started with 7 course meals! None of us can DO that anymore !! We have been VERY fortunate to be able to travel more than we ever dreamed !! Have B&B'd in Great Britain many times; visited Italy, Greece, France, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Switzerland, and Iceland (in February !) We would far rather stay in B&B, or self-catering apartment or dwelling, than be on a tour. Our trip in '09, was to 2 small towns in Sicily --Sant'Alfio, on the slope of Mount Etna, in a 15th century, converted winery --and a week on the north coast near Cefalu. Very few spoke English, but everyone was helpful and we managed to communicate, and had a wonderful time ! (Photos in Gallery on website below !) We  returned there in Sept. '11, for a 2 week vinyard tour with a small group, led by our local wine store owner - whose family is still in Sicily ! DH is my photographer - (and a website designer) but he insists on set-up time as well as a hot meal ! I should plan ahead for serving appeal, so he can get the best shot. I am now a SIX year survivor of colon cancer, as of 5/11, and four year of thyroid. Angels on my shoulder found both lesions before I even had symptoms ! I strongly encourage screening colonoscopies starting at age 50 -- that is ONE which can be totally avoided !

Here is a quick link to the beauty recipes I've posted (highest rated so far):http://www.recipezaar.com/r/chef=6357/253/451/18/ls=h A few things I've done:- 1. Worked part time as a Telemarketer in Oman in the Crowne Plaza Hotel. 2. Worked as a Certified Professional Tarotist (Tarot Card Reader) and done accurate predicitions for many people from different parts of the world, most memorable of which is the reading I did for my college Law lecturer and it came true. 3. Written nearly 1000 poems several of which have been published in leading newspapers, ezines and magazines both in Oman and India. 4. Worked as a Moderator on www.allpoetry.com - my BEST and FAVOURITE site on the internet. My other interests include: Numerology, Vaastu Shastra, Feng Shui, Face Reading, Reiki and Astrology! I am really very keen on getting well-versed with metaphysical sciences such as Astrology, I-Ching, Feng Shui, Runes, Enneagram, Kabbalah and many more. I love researching on the mythology of ancient Goddesses and then condensing my research into poems. In the mood to gift me something?

I like a variety of foods and I have cook books from my family and from several of the ladies I did home health care for over the years,  The recipes are old and sometimes instructions are not what i would like . I tended to use their recipes as it was often easier getting people to eat food they were accustomed to. The handwritten cards were sometimes hard to read but I've done my best to be true to the recipes. I've cooked in restaurants in the past as well, but I can't stay on my feet long some days so I cook pretty fast .

84961,353579,https://www.food.com/user/353579,pattikay in L.A.,"Welcome to my page! It's a good place to start looking if you need to find me since I come here nearly every day for inspiration as I pursue the noble occupation of feeding family and friends. My family moved across the country to southern California 7 years ago. The first time I ever set foot on California soil (or anywhere in the West, for that matter) was the day I moved here. I experienced a form of culture/environment shock for about a year - even the air is different out here! For the first year, I would look at the roads and driveways that wind steeply up and down the foothills and think, Man, how does anyone drive on those in the winter? Then I would remember - they do it the same way they do in the summer - with their windows down, wearing shorts and flip-flops. I love the fact that we are near a large city, near the ocean, near the desert, near the mountains - what more could I ask for? And yes, even though I swore it wouldn't happen to me after living for more than 40 years in places with many weather extremes - I now get chilly when the temperature dips below 70 and can barely bring myself to go outdoors if it's raining. However, I do NOT wear a parka and mittens when it's 65 degrees - a sweatshirt or light jacket will do. My husband and I met while attending seminary (I dropped out before finishing one semester but he got a Master of Divinity) and we got married after knowing each other for 6 months. We are quick to tell other people that we do not advise this course of action, but we celebrated our 27th anniversary this year, so I guess sometimes rash decisions work out quite nicely. So with my husband's MDiv and my undergraduate degree in religious studies, we now both work in pharmaceutical marketing research. Just what you would expect, right? I telecommute to the east coast for work each day; I'm primarily a writer/analyst. When I was in college, writing so many research papers and unable to decide what I wanted to do when I grew up, I used to jokingly say that I should find a job writing research papers. More than 20 years later, that?s basically what I do. Cool, huh? Our wonderful son was born when we were married just one year and a mere 15 years later our bright-eyed redhead came into our lives (okay, so she was totally bald till she was nearly 2, but she's definitely red now). My kids are my best and constant reminder that perfect timing is something determined by God and not by me, since I wouldn't have dreamed up such a family-planning scheme, and yet it works just right for us. Here are some pics of the family, most of them taken while we were camping and hiking in the wilds of this beautiful state! Cooking is a great joy to me ? I constantly marvel that God gave us so many things to eat and so many ways to prepare them! We could have been like cattle or something, eating pretty much the same thing, in the same way, every day for all of our lives. What a privilege to be in charge of feeding our families (and ourselves, of course), and also being able to express our creativity and knowledge of nutritional needs at the same time. (Dessert is a nutritional need, right?) I stumbled on this site when I was searching for recipes that might use up some ingredients I had in the house ? I don?t think I?ve left since then, and I?m happy to have met and shared recipes with so many nice folks around the world.

She is a cross between a poodle and a jack Russell and is now four years old. I love my garden and growing everything   I just have a small plot, so I like things that grow well in pots, and of course cooking. I love all cook books so I cant pick one but I have one that I refer to a lot Delia Smith's complete cookery course, a good all rounder. I have discovered that I am now diabetic and have had to change my eating and cooking habits I now try to go for the healther option rather than all the cream, butter and sugar, and I have lost 32 pounds, and feel so much better. My mum and all her family were diabetic and so far I am the only one of 8 kids to get it, just my luck, but in a way it's a blessing, as I now have a healthy diet not like before stuffing my face with all sorts. my peeves are I don't like cruel or rude people that don't consider other peoples feelings and opinions, manners and a smile don't cost a penny, so why be greedy and not spread a bit of happiness about, I am quite a softy at heart but don't mess with my kids or grand kids I am very protective of them and would do anything for them,  as I always tell my grandchildren it's nice to be nice makes you feel good and we all like that, I used to run a bakers shop and the old folks that came in were so lonely sometimes you were the only person that they spoke to in days or weeks so a smile and a friendly wee chat would make there day so if I can make one person smile in a day that would be great  and I have brought my kids up to think the same and the grand kids too.I am married to my dear old man for 40 years this may and can't believe where all the years have gone, they do say time passes fast when you are having a good time so I guess I am having a good time DH said I am having a good time when I am telling him what to do, I say I'm just keeping him right so he will be happy well that my story and I am sticking to it. he he he. .  [/",Contributor,4.7,,2008-01-01,2,19,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pie.png,2913

Recipezaar has made it so incredibly easy to meet these goals!!! I am totally obsessed with cooking, and I couldn't stop if I wanted to. It is as natural to me as breathing. I can remember looking through my mother's cookbooks as soon as I could read. While I mostly prefer modern recipes, I do have some old time favorites. I use the same Betty Crocker cookbook my mother uses. It is the 2nd Edition Betty Crocker cookbook reprinted in 1956. I found it at a used book store. I also use a Pillbury cookbook, a Fanny Farmer cookbook, The New Basics Cookbook and Great Good Food (both by Julee Ross). I also find good recipes in Cooking Light and Southern Living magazines. While I have discovered and love Paula Deen, my cooking is taking a new direction. I am trying to eat more monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), less saturated fats, more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fiber, and more omega 3s, i.e., basically the Mediterranean diet. I am doing it not only to maintain a healthy weight, but also for my long term health. I am not saying goodbye to all the luscious things I used to eat, I am just changing how much of those I eat. I am probably somewhat demanding in my reviews. If the recipe is not a WOW meal, I probably won't give it a 5 star rating. With so many recipes on 'Zaar, there is no reason to settle for less than 5 stars every night of the week! I have recenlty become interested in foodie fiction, since I am a foodie! Someday I will write a book that involves cooking. I am not sure if I should write a fiction book or non fiction, but I know that I love to read anything that involves cooking.",Contributor,4.6,212,2006-02-01,7,3,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/fruit-kebab.png,982

My rating system: 5 stars if the recipe works without having to make changes (my own subs just for personal preference do not count) *New Rule: If hubby says ""mmmm"" or ""this is good"" without me asking if he likes it, it automatically gets five stars 4 stars if the recipe needs a minimal amount of changing because the recipe does not work the way it was written or if overall it just didn't WOW me. 3 stars and below if the recipe just does not work or if the instructions are not written clearly enough to make it. Please know that I will change your recipe to fit my diet. I mean no disrespect, but since I have to diet I have to do it. I refuse to limit myself to recipes that already fit my diet and like the challenge of changing already existing recipes to be healthier. I will leave out the oil, leave out or replace the cheese and milk with a non-dairy alternative, and use whole grains. I will also leave out meat and broth and choose vegetarian, low sodium versions/alternatives. I still rate recipes that I make these changes to. But, if I use a recipe as inspiration only- meaning I got a great idea from it but changed it all around- I generally will not give any stars but will put a little note stating what I did. I love to give credit where credit is due. I don't deduct stars if I personally do not like an ingredient in the recipe. I don't make recipes that I think that I won't like, which is why you will probably notice that most of my ratings are pretty high.

While I grew up watching my Italian grandmother in the kitchen, I remained uninterested in trying anything on my own. As a young lady, I was known for being particularly ignorant in the kitchen, with no idea how to even make a hot dog! All this changed, however, when I got engaged. I realized it was time to let my inherent talents out of the bag. At the time, the New York Times had a weekly column called The 60-Minute Gourmet by Pierre Franey. Each week, I would follow these recipes diligently, and taught myself to cook that way. From there, I began to read cookbooks and consult with relatives on family recipes. At my ripe old age now, I feel I know enough to put together a very pleasing meal and have become accomplished in my own right. Having an Irish father and an Italian mother, I'm glad I inherited the cooking gene (and the drinking one too!). One thing I have learned is that simpler is always better! I always believe cooking fills a need to nurture and show love. After being widowed fairly young and living alone with my dog and cats, I stopped cooking for awhile, since I really had no one to cook for.

85090,358513,https://www.food.com/user/358513,Jamilahs_Kitchen,Ramadan Kareem Thanks for visiting my page and reviewing my recipes. I found Zaar after I got married and it's been such a lifesaver and so much fun. I enjoy the games and DH and DS enjoy the food!I usually work as a surgical tech but since my son was born I moved into my new profession as a stay at home mom. It's a nice change I've been enjoying it and it gives me more time to COOK! I like to share recipes that I enjoy or have eaten at some of my fav places. I'm a San Diegan currently living in New York with my Husband and our 15month old Son. When I first came to zaar I recipe selected mostly 4 and 5 rated recipes but now after playing several games and seeing the different ways people review. I realize so many recipes miss a good chance. So now I just go by ingredients or a good idea and choose my recipes based on that. I've been lucky enough to grow up eating a variety of cuisines from various cultures and have eaten at some really great restaurants from hole in the wall to 5star. So I let my palate do the choosing and so far I've had pretty good luck picking recipes. I don't generally rate recipes by cooking time or exact measurement of ingredients unless it's a baking recipe or the temp and time were just way off. I also won't give a bad rating because of my lack of ingredients or skill. I don't measure when I cook unless it's baking. I give the recipe a good read and eyeball the amounts. This works for me. I know everyone has different tastes and I will be hard pressed to give a rating of 3 unless it just really didn't work for me. I don't see any reason to hurt anyone's feelings when I can just give a detailed review of my changes or no rating instead.

I have loved cooking for as long as I can remember, and have become completely addicted to browsing through Zaar looking for new recipes! I have a small animal shelter for rabbits and guinea pigs, and spend most of my time looking after kids or critters!. My favourite cookbooks are The Essential Pasta Cookbook, The Central Cookery Book, Flo Bjielkie-Peterson's Country Cookbook, and Greek Cooking (I bought that one in Greece, and it's FANTASTIC). At the minute, we are getting ready to move, which is forcing me to sort through my recipe cabinet. I have been trying out all those recipes that are scribbled on pieces of paper, or torn from magazines, so I can decide ifthey are keepers or not. So far I've found a lot of keepers, and will work at posting them on here. I'm passionate about a lot of things, mainly my kids, animals, and cooking.

All of our cats were born in the wild and adopted by us. Zaar Chefs I have met so far: Elmotoo, justcallmeToni, ~Rita~, Midwest Maven, Bird&Buddha (both of them) and most recently, Ms*Bindy from upstate New York:) Wonderful, sweet, friendly people and great chefs! Most relevant thing to mention here is that I am a vegetarian, and recently became a vegan (almost 100%). To put vegetables and other things not meat or fish on the table I work as an actuary (in my case anyway, a combination of statistician, number-cruncher and/or programmer). For fun I like to travel. Just came back from Namibia, a peaceful democracy in Africa with lots of animals! Got some terrific pictures of lions, leopards, cheetahs, elephants, rhinocerous, hyenas, all kinds of antelopes, giraffes and zebras. Namibia is the second most sparsely populated country per square mile, just behind Mongolia. Update:  We went to Italy this Spring.  We had lots of pizza and pasta.  The pizza is so much better in Italy, particularly the crust.  The Amalfi coast was absolutely beautiful.  Spectacular natural scenery (Canada and Alaska are really beautiful, Patagonia in Chile is sublime, Iceland is unique) has been my latest passion as far as travel destinations but I have seen quite a few big cities too (Paris, Berlin, London and Madrid to name a few). On my bulletin board at work I keep a list of every country I've visited (other than the U.S. of course). So far I've made it to five continents: Europe, Africa, South America, Asia and North America of course. I've got only two other continents to conquer:) I don't usually have difficulty finding vegetarian dishes here in the U.S. or overseas, but finding vegan dishes is much harder. I have no kids, just cats, Kumquat, Cranberry, and more recently Quincy and Kiwi. They are purebreds, of the breed alley caticus (okay, American shorthair I guess). Our cats are not vegetarians, though my boyfriend (significant other, long-term partner, whatever) is. I am a friend of all animals both tamed and wild. In addition I am a freethinker and my boyfriend studies philosophy. Either way, we get along pretty well.  Also, please allow me to say that my BF and I recently bought a condominium in NYC.:)  Pet peeve? Okay, I don't like public scenes, especially parents yelling at their children, lovers' spats, etc. If it must be done please do it in private:D Participation & Awards:",Contributor,4.6,"New York City, 72",2005-02-01,1,30,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pop.png,620

I've worked for the US Postal Service for the past 15 years and love my job! I've been married for 27 years to my best friend and have beautiful twin daughters (pictured below). One is an art major and musician (she plays viola, guitar, piano, drums, and has the voice of an angel). The other is a French major, Starbucks barista, and ballet dancer, formerly with Ballet Magnificat and now an apprentice with the contemporary ballet company, Arova. My biggest pet peeve? People who bash the Post Office. Given the resources it has the Post Office does a remarkable job. For less than 50¢ someone will come to your house, pick up a letter and deliver it to the other side of the country in a few days time. What a bargain! The majority of postal workers I know are dedicated hard-working employees who take pride in their jobs. Just like in any company/organization you will find some slackers but the reason so much is heard about bad service or bad employees in USPS is because the Post Office is one of the only agencies that touches every American's life. Anytime you have a service problem, instead of just complaining to your friends & family, ask to speak to the postmaster/station manager. If you don't get the result you want write a letter to your congressman. All congressional inquiries are promptly addressed. The fact is that most people find it easier to complain and do nothing rather than do what needs to be done to address the issue.

I thank God that I am so much better today after more than two years recovery, with total mobility and just some minor pain in my arms and hands.  Cooking and communicating here was not really on my priority list.  But, I am back in action and ready to cook, take photos, and enjoy this wonderful community of friends.

I've just started a food blog and would love for those interested in cooking and recipes to check it out. You can follow my food journey at http://onecookbookatathyme.wordpress.com/ Cooking for family and friends is one of my favorite things to do. I spend most of my free time in the kitchen, either checking out Recipezaar or experimenting with a newly found recipe. My DH and I are both from Texas and we both come from Italian families. Anyone who stops by my house should be prepared to eat!!! I'm always forcing friends and family to try whatever it is that just came out of the oven. I know that is a horrible habit but I can't break it... I think it must be the Italian in me! LOL :) My sister (Cookin_Kit) and I used to help my Mom (JudaThann) in the kitchen a lot growing up. I guess that is where my love for cooking began. I also enjoy sharing the kitchen with my DH (Sgt. Pepper). He doesn't cook as often as he did when we first got married, but he makes an awesome pizza and still makes them at least twice a month. He keeps his recipes for the dough and the sauce top secret, even from me. LOL I have two step-children. The oldest graduated from college and the youngest is a sophomore at Texas Tech. I also have two cats and a dog. When I?m not cooking or hanging out here at Zaar, I like to knit, garden, read, watch old movies, travel, take photos, scrapbook, volunteer at a non-kill animal shelter, and spend time with my family and friends. I'm a co-host with Karen From Colorado in the Mexican/Tex-Mex/Southern United States Cooking Forum. Come visit us sometime!

I grew up in the US, but I have spent most of the last few years in Europe now live in Germany, with my German husband. Much of the time that I have lived in Europe, I have lived in international student housing so I have lived with and cooked with people from all over world. I have also have had to learn to improvise a bit because it isn't always easy to get the foods I miss from the US here. My husband is a good cook and likes to cook when he has time, but he quite often makes what he knows, mainly German food. So I am the one feeding him strange things. :D My husband has recently taken up hunting so I am having to learn how to cook game: wild boar, deer, hares and geese are the most common things hunted here. It isn't easy to find things for wild boar so I am trying to publish ones that I find that we really liked. I like Recipezaar because I can easily find recipes for whatever I am in the mood, or whatever I happen to have laying around when I am too lazy to walk to the supermarket. :) I like trading tips with the people at the Asian and the German/Benelux forums, I lurk there mostly, but post when I have questions or think that I can help. My reviews are mainly 4 or 5 stars because I won't try anything that I don't think that I will like. 5 stars is it was great, will make again, only very minor changes were made, if any. 4 stars is it was very good, will probably make again, made some changes to adjust to my taste. 3 stars is it was okay, probably won't make again but I didn't really mind eating it. I haven't had anything here that I thought was lower than that, which is good with how picky I am. I'll try most new things if it sounds good, but I am not afraid to say if I don't like it. I quite often make my own recipes out of some of the ones I find here, and don't post recipe reviews if I radically changed it.",Contributor,4.6,,2007-03-01,11,4,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pie.png,3615

You can not open a bag or container of cheese, yogurt, sour cream...or well, really anything dairy without him promptly being under foot! He is also a firm believer in the 5 second rule, and I'm okay with that. ;) I only like to review the recipes that we truly enjoyed! Sure, I've had my share of duds ... but just because I don't like it doesn't mean someone else might enjoy the heck out of it! So, I choose not to leave bad reviews that may sway someone else from trying a recipe. One of my peeves are the reviews that say something along the lines of... I changed this, I changed that, and your recipe was just awful! I may make changes to the recipe (usually not more than full fat to low fat / no fat ingredients - with an exception to sweets, then it's dump in the butter and pour in the sugar missy!), but I feel no need to point that out in my review. After all, it was your recipe that was at the base of any meal I make from it, and so the stars belong to you!",Contributor,4.5,,2006-01-01,1,2,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/fruit-kebab.png,4244

A baby born in each of my decade 20's 30's 40's!!! plus 2 grandsons now. I love to cook and hardly ever repeat a recipe. I never really had a fav cookbook but I now have a favorite recipe site that I am totally addicted to-RECIPEZAAR!!! I still email recipes to my own kids. My pet peeve is those folks who turn their noses up at a dish even before they try it. My family have sat at the table with a pig tail or a chicken foot on their plate just becuz I found a recipe - HAHAHa - cooking should be fun and very once in a while the dogs get a treat! I also love watching decorating shows and my husband keeps promising to put wheels on the furniture to make room arrangments easier! We don't hobby farm anymore on our 8 acres and the large veg garden has been made over - half rock garden and other half with 12 new raised cedar beds because I am getting old and the knees don't work so well. It is fabulous and will post a new cover pic altho I love my Inukshuks!!

Liked enough to print out and place in my permanent cookbook. 3*** Recipe not quite for me, but others might like it. Could be more to my liking with a few modifications. 2** Didn't like.

If you really look, you can see the sign waaaayyy back there behind us! Don't I look like a star in my shades?? ;) I live in a town of about 1500 and work at an insurance office here in town. I am married with a 13 year old daughter, a 32 year old stepson and, as of Dec 11, 04, a daughter in law. They now have a one year old daughter, Natalie. She's a sweetie! I love NASCAR!! Root for Tony Stewart. Ya I know, alot of people don't like him, but love the bad boy attitude!! We go to a couple of races a year; love it!! I confess...I'm a redneck!!! I like to read, cross-stitch and I love to cook when the weather turns cool. I love music, mainly country and classic rock. I love to sing, too, but nobody else would enjoy it, so I keep that to myself!! I love to go out with girlfriends, have a few drinks and dance the night away. I like to ride my bike and walk when the weather is warm. I love the outdoors and would rather work in the yard anytime than in the house. My daughter plays on a traveling softball team in the summer, so that keeps us busy about every weekend. Actually, they practice most of the year, so we're never too far from a softball field!! She also plays softball at school, so we go from one team to the next! I love it and will miss it when she's too old to play! She pitches and plays 1st base. Her new coach is going to try her at third this year, so that will be something new for her. I LOVE any kind of animal, especially dogs, and am very concerned about animal welfare, especially Greyhound rescue. The retired racers go through so much and are so appreciative when they finally get to go home with someone! If I had the time & the cash, I would run away to a tropical island. There's nothing better than swaying palm trees, balmy breezes and turquoise water. I love to wake up in the morning and hear the waves crashing. A cold margarita isn't a bad addition, either! I LOVE dogs; I have really grown to love Greyhounds; what personality!! We adopted Missileman on May 15, 2006; a great birthday gift for me!! He is a retired racer, but now seems happy just to be a dog! We also have a 5 year old yellow cat, Drew. A real troublemaker! We also have a 5 year old Black Lab named Angus. He is actually my stepson's dog, but it seems we're his permanent family! We also have an adopted fur baby, Tanner. He actually belongs to the neighbor, but he loves us and visits everytime he escapes!! There are three things I want to do before I die (well, more than 3, I'm sure, but...) I want to visit Hawaii and Australia and I want to swim with dolphins. My pet peeves are two faced, backstabbing people. And, people who only want to be a friend when you can do something for them. Those people may as well stay away from me; life's too short to deal with 'em!! I've ""met"" alot of interesting people here at Zaar and can't wait to see what's going on every morning when I log in!! I've been in a few swaps over the last year and had a great time!!

85409,25792,https://www.food.com/user/25792,LAURIE,"Before I get to the details let me tell you how I rate recipes.....and tell you how I feel about others ratings! 5 STARS....This recipe was excellant, we liked it very much, the directions were very clear and if I made any minor substitutions I noted it. It would most likely be made again, many times! 4 STARS....This recipe was good, we liked it but I made changes either in taste or it was not clear in something, but I would consider making it again. 3 STARS....This recipe was not something that got approval from the majority. Either it just didnt work in preparation, directions, or taste. I will tell you why and would not make it again unless I altered it much! 2, 1 STARS.....I DO NOT give these as I feel they are NOT worthy....especially if the recipe previously had good reviews and by my giving a low one would jeopardize the ratings. I would appreciate this reciprocated with reviews to my recipes. 0 STARS....COMMENTS I will leave no stars and comments on something that did not work out for me and I will be honest and tell you why. I DETEST IT WHEN PEOPLE CHANGE YOUR RECIPE OR DONT EVEN MAKE IT THEN LEAVE YOU LOW REVIEWS. PEOPLE WHO DO THAT ARE JUST BEING VINDICTIVE OR JUST PLAIN STUPIDLY CRUEL. Examples of some I've gotten would be: 1 star...This doesnt sound like something we would like 2 stars...too sweet for me, (this was on a all 5 star recipe). Now for the details: I was born, raised and still live in the same midwestern town where comfort food is what we thrive on, however my dream is to retire to the northwoods of Wisconsin.. (the sooner the better IMHO)! I relish a recipe that is simple, quick and tastes great as I am a divorced mom to 4 very busy, active young adults (27, 25, 20 year old daughters and a 21 year old son.) Cooking time is at a premium as everyone is so busy, I never usually know who will be at my house for supper! I also try to find things that will reheat well. I have worked for 30 years in the accounting field and presently semi retired. It is very nice for a change to not have to deal with the everyday stress of deadlines and office politics! It has been great cooking for pleasure, at my leisure, instead of to feed the troops! Cooking relaxes me so I do it often and I love to cook for people who appreciate it. It is nothing for me to start a recipe at 10pm right before bedtime, and yes I have cooked all nite. Kind of a marathon!! Cookbooks are my passion and I can't resist the ones that churches, schools etc. put together and well as the ones in the grocery stores. My collection numbers well over 2000 and where as some people go to bed with a good novel, my nightstand is full of cookbooks! I love to bake and its nothing for me to make 15-20 different kinds of cookies and candies for the holidays. I guess that it has rubbed off on my oldest daughter who is a culinary school graduate and knee deep in pastry classes, hoping to become a pastry chef! In March of 2002 I had gastric bypass, weight loss surgery and I have lost 125 pounds FOREVER, so now when I do cook it IS for everyone else to enjoy. I love Zaar and all the friends I have made here, this sight is so addictive but yet so much fun! And the recipes aren't bad either..LOL! I know that in the years since Ive been a permanent fixture of this site I have acquired many great recipes and tons of cooks that I am proud to call my friends!

I want to say THANK YOU    to all of you who try my recipes. I may not always get back with a Thank you in writing but I want you to know I do thank you very much. I appreciate any and all comments, it can only help me learn and become a better chef. I love to travel and see anything and everything. When summer comes, I am off to see. DH and I traveled across country several times and our children are seasoned travelers as well. Road Trip are 2 of my favorite words. The kids and I have done a few trips as well down the eastern seaboard and there are plans for more. Both DD and DS are gypsies as well and think nothing of taking a road trip to visit home or each other. LOVE IT I live in Western New York and love it here, snow and all.

I also love to read, listen to music and watch good movies. We have Friday night pizza night here, which means I do not cook! I love Friday's. I started this custom when my children were small and we would cuddle on the floor and play games together and eat pizza. (Highly recommended for all moms out there, dads too.) I LOVE THAT! My favorite cookbook has changed since I came to Zaar, it is now the Zaarworld cookbook. I can get everything I need here and then some, to cook up meals for family and friends.

I've also got 2 painted turtles named Dennis and Fuzz, and a bunch of fish (koi and goldfish, along with the guppies & swordtails in the turtle tank). I USUALLY eat and cook healthy, but I rarely pass up dessert, either. I do not eat red meat, and try to limit other animal products, too. I love to bake, although I seem to collect a lot of scone and biscotti recipes which I NEVER get around to making. I bake and eat A LOT of cookies and muffins... I almost always reduce the sugar by 1/4 and use whole wheat pastry flour for at least part of the flour. Those two changes do so much to make recipes healthier without compromising taste. I try to reduce fat whenever I can, too, but while I want to eat healthy, I still want to ENJOY what I eat!!! I seem to give a lot of 4 and 5 star reviews here - I seem to have a pretty good sense of what I like by looking at a recipe before I try it.

I love to cook, and like having my little helpers in the kitchen! I usually love recipes that are completely from scratch (I still love them actually) but right now my focus is on having any kind of food ready by mealtime! It's a little crazy here lately. Every summer we have a huge organic garden, apple orchard and raspberry and blueberry patches, along with a woods full of wild foods waiting for me to learn what they are so I can collect them. I'm learning about wild mushrooms first, so if anyone has any tips, let me know. We also eat wild venison which my husband and I hunt ourselves. It's our favorite meat, since it's lean, organic and cheap! Some of my hobbies are: hiking, biking, rock climbing, gardening, playing in the water with my kids, or just swinging in the hammock with a good book.

For those of you that don't know, Tucson is a culinary Mecca; tons of amazing flavors, foods, and restaurants to investigate. The above photo is a picture of my husband and I on our wedding day. He's the light of my life, and the main reason I'm glad I moved out here to the desert because I never would have met him if I hadn't!! To top it off, he's a great eater. It doesn't matter what I make, even if he doesn't like it he tells me between bites. (haha!) He loves my obsession with the Zaar because he's been eating really well since I started with the site. We recently bought our first house which is a starter home that we are working very hard on remodeling. Anyone with free advice for newbie homeowners lemme know because it has been a whirlwind!! I am currently a full time employee at the UofA (GO WILDCATS!) and I love my job and the people that I work with. I am also a part time student seeking a Masters degree in Administration. I can't wait to be finished so that I can relax for a little while, cook, work on my house, and play with my two beautiful children who are pictured below (yes I'm aware that they are dogs, but they are OUR kids!!) The one on the left is our little blue heeler mix that we call Rumplestiltzkin (Bumpy for short) and the one on the left is the sweetest Chow Retriever Mix you'll ever meet. His name is Gaizen. The picture of the two dippy looking people on Segways is one of my husband and I in Disney World this last October. We were soooo lucky to beable to go on the segway tour it was loads of fun! The cutie patutie right beside us is my little niece Rylee who I don't get to see nearly enough since my sister live in Ohio. She's couldn't be sweeter if you spread icing on her. The picture of the cake is one that I made for my DH's 27th birthday because he loves fish tanks. Anyone that wants the ingredients and how to build it lemme know it's really easy!! My Rating System: 5 stars-RUN don't walk to your grocery store, buy the ingredients and make this! 4 stars-Great recipe and I want to try it again but would probably make changes to it 3 stars-Pretty good recipe that I liked but probably will only make occasionally I don't like to give less than three stars because everyone is different and has different taste buds. I also will not give a recipe less than four stars if I myself made changes to the recipe and then didn't like the way it turned out. If I screw a recipe up entirely (I have been known to do this especially with baked goods) I don't bother even rating it. The one thing that is really hard to say here at the Zaar is ""I will definitly make this again"" not because soooo many recipes that I have tried are not worthy of making again, but because there are so many more out there that I haven't tried yet! Every time I think of repeating one of my favorites I find myself on here about to look it up, and then finding something just as interesting, unique, and delicious sounding that I just have to try!!",Contributor,4.6,,2007-02-01,10,27,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pasta.png,4386

So, because of this, he brings alot of my stuff to his work whereby his co-workers can eat my wares nowadays. I enjoy trying new foods, but have an issue with snails and frogs and organ meats, so you won't see me eating that kind of stuff, but otherwise I will try just about anything! My favorite ethnic foods are Italian and Greek. I grew up near Tarpon Springs, FL which is where the largest Greek population is outside of Greece. Fantastic food! Half of my family is Jewish and Scicilian(don't ask), so I have very fond memories of my Bubby cooking, effortlessly it seemed, so many wonderful dishes that we still eat today. I am always looking on RecipeZaar for foods that she made so I can try to replicate them the way she would have. My favorite restaurant is any place that makes good food at a reasonable price, and that allows me and my family to enjoy it without being rushed. Out of all the chain restaurants that there are, my favorites are probably Firebirds, Bonefish,?The Olive Garden, Carrabba's Italian Grill, Red Lobster( although its been quiteawhile since they have served me something good here). We cannot forget the best BBQ that there is as well -CORKY's! Yummm... We have a lot of hometown cookery's here in the area , so we enjoy a lot of them as well.",Contributor,4.9,"Collierville, Tennessee",2006-01-01,0,0,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pop.png,9881

I started baking at a very early age and my mother was always supportive (even tho she probably did not have time). By the time I was 12 I was competing in local fairs and won quite a few ribbons. Later in my teens I added cooking (French style) to my hobbies and still prefer this style of cooking. Now we spend 6 months of the year in Southern Portugal and have learned a lot about the Portuguese cuisine. Do prefer the Norhern Portugal type of cooking, but they have the most wonderful bread in the world. I have one daughter who trained as a French chef and worked in that field for several years. Since then she has gone on to other things. I don't have a favorite cookbook because I have too many to choose from. Since having the internet at my fingertips I have certainly expanded my recipe collections. I do take pride in serving good meals even for just the 2 of us. Luckily I have a husband who is a great taster and willing to try just about anything. My pet peeve is to be served food on a cold plate in a restaurant.

85661,400420,https://www.food.com/user/400420,MarlaM,"I'm the mother of an awsome 17 year old daughter, who keeps me very busy. She is now driving and constantly wanting to take the car somewhere. She is a pretty amazing person - she does well in school, helps around the house, is very responsible and actually keeps her room pretty clean! I feel very lucky! She is also developing a love of cooking, but right now it is mostly cookies and brownies. I think she really likes the thought that she can produce something really delicious and impress her boyfriend :-) She also developed a love of sewing after not being able to find clothes that fit the way she likes them. She alters almost everything she buys! And it really comes in handy when I need something sewn! In January, I accepted a position as a Compliance Manager overseeing 4 branches of a major investment firm. It has been very challenging, but I'm learning a lot, and while I'm very overwhelmed, I'm really enjoying it. When I started this job, my office was in Torrance, but after a month, my office was moved to Santa Monica - right on the Promenade and just 2 blocks from the beach and Santa Monica Pier. Very cool area, all types of people walking around all the time. Not sure if I'll be in that location permanently, as it is quite far from home, but I'm liking it so far. My mom subscribed to the Taste of Home and Quick Cooking magazines and always ordered the annual cookbooks. When she passed away, I inherited all of her cookbooks. I've started to post recipes from those books, because it helps me keep track of my favorites. We have a very sweet 6 year old greyhound mix, Sally, who keeps us constantly entertained. She is very lovey and playful, but is always looking for trouble :-) On 1/3/08 we brought home our newest pup, Lucy, a very sweet beagle we found at the animal shelter. Sally isn't quite sure what to make of her yet, but Lucy would really like to play with her, so hopefully they will become friends. We also have a little grey cat who we just call Kitty. He is one of those cats who keeps to himself most of the time, but on the weekend mornings he demands attention and wants to play - but just for a little while, then he retreats to his room (my DD's room) and sleeps the day away. Since I found RecipeZaar, I've developed a reputation with my friends and family as a fabulous cook! This site gives me the tools to try things I never would have thought I could make! I've always been an OK cook, but in the last year or so, I've suddently realized that I really enjoy cooking and entertaining. I don't like spending hours in the kitchen, though, so I'm always on the lookout for quick and easy recipes and I've found so many here. As most people do, I usually start with a recipe and change it to suit the taste of my family or to what I have on hand. I throw together my own dishes often, but haven't posted them, because I never measure anything and just add ingredients to taste. Both of my parents were excellent cooks - both actually cooked in restaurants and my dad owned a restaurant for a few years. All of my friends loved eating at my house when I was a kid, because there was always something good cooking. My mom always had a garden and apricot tree, and she loved canning. We never had store bought jams, dill pickles or canned tomatoes when I was growing up. These days, my pantry has all store bot stuff - I always watched my mom do her canning, but never learned. Unfortunately, my recent love of cooking has shown in the wastelines of both myself and my husband. Now I'm starting to look for lower fat and calorie recipes and trying to learn how to lower the fat in the meals that I love. Pet Peeves...Mean reviews! I've seen so many mean reviews just because someone didn't like the recipe. Just because one person doesn't like a dish, doesn't mean someone else won't think it is a 5 star recipe! Also, it seems like every recipe that says ""authentic, from my grandmother who lived in (you name the country)"", someone has to say that the recipe isn't authentic. Just because one German family makes something different than another German family doesn't make it any less authentic. Different regions tend to have variations.

I now work at the Boys & Girls Club of America here in my hometown. I also am a substitute teacher. Once a teacher, always a teacher. I enjoy cooking, especially for friends and family. I even prepare meals for my co-workers and take to work. They really enjoy them. Some foods I prepare, they have never had. My biggest meal of the year is at Christmas. Since I am not married and no children, my mother (since my father passed in 2003) and brother and his family comes for Christmas dinner. He has 8 children (whom are all grown up) and 7 grandchildren. So, I begin preparing,making the menu, buying items for dinner the day after Thanksgiving. > Participated in Two for One Participating in Hail to theChefs Participating in Everyday is a Holiday Tag Participated in Make My Recipe-Christmas Edition '09 Participated in My 3-Chefs -2009 Slide into Sides One Dish Wonders- 2009 Participating in Make My Recipe-2009 Participated in Think Pink An Apple a Day-2009 Eggs and Dairy Tag-2009 Participating in Bargain Basement Participating in Newest Zaar Newest Zaar Team Participated in Easy Did It For Me-2008 This Little Pig Went to Market Participated in Bellywarmers-2008 Participated in Hot, Spicy and Tasty Participated in Summer Salads-2009 Participated in Live Strong-2009 Cajun Cooking hosted by me-2009 Participating in 1-2-3 Hit Wonders Participated in PAC 2009 I was adopted in Adopt-a-Chef-2009",Contributor,4.6,"Hemingway, 80",2001-11-01,3,54,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/taco.png,4534

Might need some slight changes, but in general the recipe works and others might enjoy this more than I did. 2 Stars: Fair, recipe did not work out well for me and I cannot recommend it. Not what I was expecting. 1 Star: Poor, recipe did not work at all and I would caution others to consider another recipe. ----------------------------- Well, obviously I love to cook since I'm here on Zaar! Besides that (in the food dept) I've got my hands in a little of everything. I do a lot of canning these days. As well as drying and freezing. I do a lot of berry picking in the summer as well as other wild foraging. I'm just learning, but I'm coming along fast. I love plants and botony so learning about local eatables and herbs has always been an interest. Plus home gardening ofcoarse :) But I don't have much room right now. I've just started experimenting with home brewing (trying some basic and easy wines and meads) Hopfully I'll eventually become adept at that and be the family's Merry maker lol Any tips are welcomed! Ideally I spend most of my time trekking around the woods and mountains here in PA looking for adventures and hidden treasures, old ruins, and historical trails. ( I may have an overactive imagination :). I love backpacking and camping. If there wasn't anyone around to drag me home I'd probably just disppear into the wilderness never to return. I have a major interest in Mythology and History (focusing mainly on Ancient Greece, but I'm enthralled by all ancient history and interested in anything up until the second half of the 20th century) I really enjoy learning the old ways of doing things. I'm definitely not suited to this cellphone infested, computer run, digitalized existence we're living, it all just hurts my head and makes me wonder if anyone has any original thought or imagination left. Halloween (Samhain) is another of my favorite things in the world. I wait for it all year and make a full week out of it. Building props and setting up yard displays keeps my head spinning strait through Sept and Oct. I admit I still go trick or treating some years. Other years I try to organize scavenger hunts or treasure hunts etc. Wish I could get more people interested though! Usually just 3 or 4 of us. I also do all the traditional things for a proper Pagan New Year so it's a very busy week! I love summer and I live for the heat. 90 degrees is when I feel the best. I hate the cold! Despite that Autumn is my favorite time of year though! Fairs, festivals (anyone who lives in PA knows we have some of the most crazy, odd and fun festivals!), Harvest feasts, Fall foraging and gathering, corn field fights, haunted hayrides, pumpkin patches, crafts, all the fresh veggies! The leaves ,the trees, the colors, dressing up, popcorn balls, candy apples, apple picking, apple cider, Mabon and Halloween, the smell of fires, and herbs.... I could go on and on here. My dream in life is basically to live off the grid. To own a large piece of land in the middle of nowhere surrounded by forest. Enough room to grow the majority of our own food (""our"" is still up in the air) To have a little cabin, some chickens, a couple of horses, my cats and a barn big enough to accommodate a small wildlife rehab center (I'm hoping to become certified in the next couple of years. I've rambled on enough I think.

And I had the great privilege to be mom to the world's best cat, Bentley, for almost 12 years. As of 3/10/09 he's now free from all the ailments that plagued his past few years and is now a soft and gentle spirit who will be with me always. He was my best friend and the first real love of my life and leaves a cat-shaped hole in life. February 4, 2010, 2 new kitties joined our family.  Nick and Nate were adopted from our local humane society and fill our home with purrs and laughter and lots of fur.  We're lucky to have these two sweet kitty boys with us. I'm a certified medical coder but currently enjoying being a stay-at-home cat mom.  In past work lives I've been a corporate travel consultant, an auto claim assistant, a loan clerk, a secretary and an usher. I like to cook and LOVE to bake. It's great to share the gift of good food with my sweet wonderful husband, family and friends and co-workers. And I try to enter a couple different baked goods in my county fair each year. When I'm not working in the kitchen I enjoy reading, walking, scrapbooking, genealogy, and visiting with family and friends. I also love animals, and was a cat care volunteer at a local shelter for many years.   R?E'S STAR RATINGS (effective for 2007 ratings and beyond) 5 -- Amazing! Incredible! Want to eat it or drink it all the time! Obviously this wowed us. Maybe it?s too decadent to make very often, but we can dream. 4 -- Great! We loved it and will probably be having this frequently. 3 -- Good . We liked it and might have it again, possibly with some changes. 2 -- Passable. We ate it but won?t eat any leftovers and won?t be making this again, at least not as written. This will probably be due most often to one flavor being too strong. 1 -- Inedible. There?s a critical error in the recipe.",Contributor,4.6,212,2002-01-01,33,15,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/fruit-kebab.png,902

If you ask my husband (or my coworkers), I haven't logged out since! So what's happened in the ten years since I became addicted to Zaar? Well, I've been happily married, happily divorced, and happily married once again. (Wanna see wedding pictures? Click here.) Originally from the Bronx, I've been living in Israel since 1983. I'm married to a brilliant man with the most yummy British accent (this is the part where he rolls his eyes and says, Yeah, yeah, yeah). Let's call him Sushiman, even though he hates that name. Chia gave him that nickname when I was trying to create a dinner to show off my culinary talents. I posted here on Zaar with questions about the menu and since sushi was the main focus of the meal, he became Sushiman. That dinner was just the first of what I hope will become a lifetime of meals together. This is a picture of us taken in September 2005 in Kew Gardens in London. It my favorite picture of the two of us. This comes in as a close second, taken March 2009: I have 4 of the most gorgeous daughters in the known universe (tfu, tfu, tfu, that's me spitting three times to ward off the Evil Eye). Sushiman has 4 kids of his own, so together that makes us a family of ten, together with my dog and my step-dog (sadly, since I first wrote this my step-dog, Honey, crossed the Rainbow Bridge). We're the Brady Bunch on speed. Not all eight live with us, but everyone is in and out all of the time, so we're thinking about replacing our front door with one of those revolving thingies. If you need help figuring out the whole complicated mess, you can check out Miriyummy, A Guide to the Perplexed. Here are my four beauties -- from left to right: Adiya, Sara, Nomi and Tehila On March 18, 2009, my oldest, Sara, got married to Ariel. The wedding was a clash of cultures and traditions, and we had a blast! Over 500 people attended our little party... ... and Ariel was welcomed into our family in style! If you want to see the photo album from Sara and Ariel's wedding, just go here. We're just one big happy family, most of the time, really! Here on Recipezaar I am the host of the Kosher & Jewish Cooking forum. Come on in, and let the Jewish Mothers of Zaar feed you senseless! I hope you enjoy my recipes. I have only posted recipes of food that I am willing to eat myself. Therefore, you won't find anything unkosher in my recipes. You won't find any stinky bleu cheese or goat's cheese either. You will find a lot of comfort food, I believe that comfort food is very important. Gay and Troy are always thanking us for making Recipezaar such a great place. I firmly believe that it's Gay and Troy themselves that deserve a multitude of thanks, from us! And I hope I live up to their expectations!

So I had to decide what things had to go or be changed in my life. This one relates to YOU!. If you are kind enough to review (even take pictures, WOW!) of one of my recipes, please know that I thank you very much, but you might not get a response from me unless I have some spare time. So to all of you in advance, THANK YOU! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~UPDATE: ( Sept. 6th 2009 ) WOW! Another year older and still kickin'. It has been a very busy year as last August I opened Wag Time, a doggie day care and lodging business. It has grown from one or two dogs a weekend to seven fulltime weekday pups; every weekend; and lots of vacation stayovers! I have not had a free day since Memorial Day....and I'm not complaining! Even had to hire a partime helper! So now with my four students and lots of dogs, I'm enjoying each and every day. But....other than not getting much of a social life with family and friends, I have much less time to spend on Zaar. Each time I get on, there is so much going on, so many new faces that I never see all of it. To all my loving friends on CC, please know that you are not forgotten, just on hold for a while. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I finally made it! Not that I REALLY wanted too...but somethings you have no control over. There were times that I worked really hard to avoid it, and other times when I just threw up my hands and said a big, So What! There have been those in my life that said it really doesn't matter...and yet...Oh, what am I talking about? My 65th birthday, what else? I still think it is a mistake! I DO believe my husband was sitting around the big dinner table in the sky and he told the angels that I love to pull a good prank and to get even with me for all I pulled on him, I became 65!. I know that is what happened cause everybody KNOWS I'm only thirty! Okay...forty. (Wow, this is outdated for sure!) Been cooking since I was ten, making the evening vegetable. By twelve I pretty much took over the family kitchen and I've been cooking ever since! Love all kinds of food but probably favor Asian-style cuisine the most. I LOVE to create my own thing..from breakfasts to midnite snacks and everything in between. Have six grandchildren and WAS busy making that expected cookbook for them, but I have most of it here on Zaar now. I say most of it cause I'm not finished creating different things. Guess there is only one food item that I stay strictly away from and that is okra, otherwise I'm open to try most anything...well at least a healthy taste! Update 2007: After trying to use this food item in different recipes, I have to add blue cheese to keep the okra company. Retired from a long nursing career due to poor eyesight and now am a SAHM - YES, I AM! I have international students in my home and I'm the Big Mamma!. Get lots of original recipes through them and always try to cook foods from their homelands. Due to their different likes and dislikes, I am always tweaking recipes. For the past several yrs, I have changed my eating patterns for a more healthly life style. Each New Year resolution was bringing me closer to reaching my goal. I have now stopped my changes as I feel (and my doctor) that I am in the best control in my adult life. My weight is stable at 150 (give or take a lbs or two), and at 5ft,6inches, I'm happy. My cholestrol is about the same as my weight. My B/P still needs help with some medicine, but is maintained. Only my eyes cause any problem. So after the last few years of problems, I'm grateful that God has allowed me more time to show him that I am trying to take care of the body he gave me. It sure helped to have so many Zaarites supporting and befriending me.",Contributor,4.5,,2004-12-01,2,23,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/drink.png,2222

One day the youngest boy came up to me and said ""Aunt Woofie Woof......."" and proceeded to say what he had to say. He called me that name for 2 days. When I asked him where he got the name from, his reply was ""It was on a Dr Suess tape my momma got me at the Library"". :lol: I thought it was so cute that I decided to use it on the internet. I babysat for that family for 8 years!! That little boy is now in middle school. I still see him and his family every now and then. His mom and I keep in touch over the phone. I usually spend Thanksgiving Day with them. It is fun watching the kids grow into fine young adults. The oldest daughter, is in her early 20's, is working and has her own place. She is a beautiful young lady. I am a Substitute Playground Supervisor and a Crossing Guard at an Elementary School. I love both jobs. .",Contributor,4.6,"The Great Northwest, Wa",2003-05-01,0,31,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/burger.png,625

For fun I love to read, cook, take road trips with my grandson, whom I raise. Take long walks along the beach, bays and lakes. My live in grandson is 12 and the light of my life. I've been teaching him to fish, or should I say I'm exposing him to lake fishing, the people we meet along the way are teaching him while I read and watch. He's dying to go ocean fishing, that one makes me a bit more nervous, but we'll start that soon, probably from piers to start. Nick's only one of my grandchildren though, I have a total of 13, three live in Kansas, the land of Oz. The last time I visited them, it was Christmas time and when I stepped off the plane, the cold air took my breath away and standing there waiting for me in a short-sleeved T-shirt, was my son-in-law. Needless, to say, I spent many days there staying indoors praying for the day I could get back to sunny California -- I never had to endure snow the whole time, thank God! Twenty degrees daily was way out of my comfort zone by a very large margin. There truly is no place like home. I have 8 other grandchildren that are fortunate enought to live in San Diego too. We spend weekends doing things together such as taking in the zoo, wild animal park, Sea World, Knotts Soak City water park (summer), museums, fishing, picknicking and just hanging out. They all love to help grandma cook in the kitchen. I have many cookbooks and can read them like I'd read a novel. My passions are my family, my two boston terriers, Tuffy and Oreo, and gardening, cooking and reading -- oh yeah, I'm totally addicted to Zaar. I don't really have many pet peeves, but a biggie is mean, obnoxious people and those who think they know it all, and liars, I can pick out a deceitful person it an instant. If you can't trust someone, then nothings worth salvaging in the relationship. I hate those who disrespect the environment (no I'm not a tree hugger) but I do hate to see people litter and fail to do simple things such as picking up after themselves in the outdoors such as parks and beaches, and how easy is it to recycle? It's really not too difficult to make an impact on the environment if everybody takes responsibility for their ""trash.""",Contributor,4.4,"Spring Valley, California",2004-01-01,26,22,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/sushi.png,9820

I enjoy trying new recipes and can't wait to get my son into it as well. I really enjoy baking most of all, but I find lately I am getting more into cooking as well. And I dabble in food photography so I love to get pics of the dishes I prepare. I have found so many great recipes here and I just want to say Thank You! I try a new recipe almost every night. I have started submitting some I have around here and trying to create some of my own as well so if you try any of them I hope you will like them as much as I have enjoyed all of yours. I worked as a Barista for a couple of years and I love to mix drinks up and try all sorts of flavor combinations. I am thinking about trying to start up a cooking club in my area! I am really excited about it but I am waiting until my son is a bit older and we are in the process of selling our house so I wanna wait til that is done. It will be a meet once every couple weeks or once a month sort of thing and we will all get together and prepare new dishes planned around themes. I think it will be a lot of fun! I often bore my friends talking about food so much lol. I just love to talk about recipes and the different foods out there. Lately I have joined in on many zaar games and events and am having loads of fun! It keeps me rather busy just keeping up with the threads and making so many recipes lol. But I have found MANY wonderful recipes because of them. Here is a pic of my son Perrin I took the this January. This past year I have started my photography business. It has been a lot of fun, and I hope to continue to grow with it all. I am an on location natural light photographer specializing in children, families, seniors, newborns, etc. It is such a great thing to be able to do something you love and still be able to be a SAHM which is something that is very important to me. And who doesn't love to be their own boss??? lol MY RATING SYSTEM: 5 stars ~ An incredibly delicious recipe and something I would make for company. Also the deciding factor from 4 to 5 stars is simplicity! If its super yummy AND simple to make it gets 5 stars by me! 4 stars ~ A great recipe and one I would make again. I may have made a couple small changes however to our tastes. 3 stars ~ A pretty good recipe, but not one that I would most likely make again only because I already have so many others to try, and our favorites to make again and again. Also probably needed to leave out a few too many things or add in a few of my own to get it to our tastes. 2 stars ~ Just not for us. We ate it, and tried it according to recipe directions, but the flavors or textures or some other aspect were just not something we enjoyed. 1 star ~ I wouldn't normally give a 1 star, but it would have to be a messed up recipe to get one. lol Create your own visitor map! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I have participated in the following...

DH has accepted a position in Trinidad, so we'll be visiting a totally new area and looking forward to trying some of the local food there. Update 10-15-10: We just returned home from Beijing, China and are happy to be back in Washington State, in our little town of Dayton. We truly enjoyed China and all the friends we made but missed home and family. About me - raised and educated in Las Vegas. Worked all of my career as a registered nurse mostly in Neo-Natal and Pediatrics, now retired and loving it. Have lived in Germany, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Russia and most recently Italy. We returned from China and a wonderful experiance on 10-15-2010. I'm married to a wonderful man whose job takes us to all these differant places. We have a blended family of 4 grown children, 2 boys and 2 girls. We have 5 grandsons and our first granddaughter arrived on May 26, 2007 on October 5, 2010.

I've none of my own at this time but have trained several for friends and my grandkids that have resulted in wonderful well behaved family pets. After belonging to this site for awhile and reading and enjoying AM pages my pet peeves have changed. There's 2 things that bother me, 1st is when someone leaves a poor review but no reason why - an honest review is appreciated and allows others to see what works and did not and maybe make changes, but nothing serves no purpose except to possibley hurt feelings. The 2nd is poor reviews when changes are made that change the recipe and then the reviewer wonders why it didn't turn out. Sometimes it just might be personal taste - but you can't know with out at least a short comment. Figured I should say that my rating system pretty much just follows the Zaar list. Rarely will I ever rate anything less than a 3 or 4 as I can tell by the ingrediants if I'm going to like it or not. If it doesn't work for us I figure it's personal taste or I did something wrong, in that case I'll usually write the chef and request additional information and not leave any stars.",Contributor,4.6,212,2006-12-01,4,47,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pie.png,479

We live in Southern, Ontario.  I live to cook and just love to putter around the kitchen. I enjoy reading all kinds of cookbooks which I borrow from the library or buy second hand. I really like Taste of Home magazine, because the recipes are from ordinary people and aren't too complicated. I also like to read community or church cookbooks because you know that the recipe must be special for someone to share it. I discovered RecipeZaar because it was mentioned by someone in a cooking magazine...now I am hooked. I think it is so helpful to read the reviews and suggestions from others who have tried recipes before me. I always thought of myself as a pretty good cook, but I am learning so much since I have joined RecipeZaar.

I just quit my job as an office assistant after 7 years to be the full-time ""mom"" of a darling (& feisty!) 4 year old daughter. I also left with full intentions to return to college & work on my degree ... until I ended up pregnant. Again. Our son was born this Aug. '09 and he is beautiful, healthy, just wonderful! We're so blessed. :) My husband is a United States Marine Corps veteran, having toured Iraq twice -- the second time while I was pregnant with our daughter. But he's back safe and sound. We are so lucky and have much to be thankful for! My favorite TV channel of all time (when I have time to watch) is Food Network ... it's what got me ""into"" cooking to begin with. My favorite celebrity chefs are: Rachel Ray (I think I like her personality more than her food though), Giada DeLaurentiis and Ina Garten. The latter two have made some great things. I am currently on a low-fat diet but indulge sometimes ... I have a b-i-i-i-g sweet tooth! (Maybe I should say that I just have a whole mouthful of sweet tooths ... er ... teeth). As for my biggest pet peeve in life? Well ... it doesn't have too much to do with food (depending on how you look at it) ... but it's the hiccups. I hate hearing them and I hate having them! But when I eat or drink (or laugh) too much ... they're just inevitable. I also hate it when I am looking very forward to eating something in the fridge ... and its GONE by the time I get to it (my husband is always the culprit, but he tries to blame the baby).",Contributor,4.2,,2006-05-01,0,0,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pasta.png,2962

86111,293410,https://www.food.com/user/293410,White Rose Child,"A teenager who loves to cook- weird or what? But yes, it's one of my passions! To me cooking is like an art form- there's always something new and exciting to try, and there are constantly more ideas running around in my head than I know what to do with. Now, to update this page- a little task I haven't done in about two years!! Much remains the same as when I joined what seems like ""forever ago"": I'm a vegan with many passions: music, yoga, volunteer work, healthy/tasty food (the healthy vs. the tasty seem to run in cycles, haha) - and perhaps most of all, I love the written world. My dearest happy moments are when I am reading, writing, and feeling inspired. I'm in my first year studying at Mount Allison university for a B.A., major in English. However, since this is RecipeZaar, I must note that I'm equally obsessive about food!! Six years have passed since I was twelve and sort-of accidentally converted my family to veganism. Yes, even dad and little bro now greedily dig into their tofu shepherd pie and soy ice cream (well, clearly, one AFTER the other). I'm always on the lookout for foods that will please, and maybe even be healthy for, all of us! Now that I'm in uni and living with my aunt, uncle and cousin in New Brunswick, I still try to help with the cooking a bit. My sweetie cousin, Bilious Pigeon here on Zaar, is a terrific kitchen buddy. We share a penchant for fine coffee. Thankfully, my family here has turned mostly to the vegan side and that makes university life sooo much easier! My posted recipes, those I haven't invented, might come from Vegnews magazine, another website, one of our awesome vegan cookbooks, or friends- but it's virtually guaranteed that I've modified them at least in some way, and if from a book or show, I always acknowledge the original source. After all, I'd want someone to do the same for me. Since returning to the public education system after eight years of homeschooling, I don't have quite as much time in the kitchen as I used to. But I don't let that stifle my creativity! One of my favorite activities is in the summer when I get together with another cousin ~Harriet~, who's also here on Zaar, and we cook as much as we want. Good times! One more thing about me. I'm a Zaar game addict. And proud of it, and I'd advise anyone to join who would like more reviews on their own recipes, not to mention spending time with fun people and trying recipes they might not find otherwise. Please Zmail me with any questions or just to chat. Hope you enjoy, and are inspired by, my ideas!",Contributor,4.6,,2006-02-01,32,23,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/fruit-kebab.png,619

I like to cook simple clean food. I usually don't use any packaged or processed products. Most of the time I make everything from scratch. I use only organic meat and dairy products and many other organic products and I believe it makes a big difference not only healthwise but also in taste. We have two kids. A 3 year old and a 9 year old. I try not to adapt the food for them too much. They are used to eating what we eat. Growing up I didn't really learn how to cook. At least I didn't care enough to remember anything.But living centrally in Germany I was able to travel and eat European food in it's respective Countries: Italian food in Italy, Spanish food in Spain, French food in France and so on. I really missed that when I moved to the States. I started cooking the week after I got married and have been cooking and teaching myself ever since. Now cooking is not only one of my two hobbies (photography being the other one)but I also see it as therapy.

I live in the Uk with a hungry husband and two of my three fussy daughters. We follow a low carb diet which keeps our weight in check and I can stay off he wheat....it makes me poorly. I love making cakes, cookies and desserts for family and friends. In my life I am looking for world peace, unlimited supplies of organic chocoalte & self cleaning kitchen floors! I am at my happiest when getting paid, drinking wine & cooking cakes but it makes me very unhappy when it's my turn to wash up, when someone eats my chocolate, drinks my wine or uses my toilet! I work as a part time cook in a children's centrel. My afternoon job sees me as parish administrator at my local church. Outside of work I try to be as inactive as possible, although I do a bit of dog walking with ozzy (thankfully he only has little legs and doesn't need to go far. I am also interested in working towards early retirement, we intend to leave the kids in the house, travel around Europe in a silver camper van 'doing' all the F1 Grand Prix spending their inheritance as we go!! My favourite films in no particular order are: Pulp Fiction, Blues Brothers, Dirty Dancing, Fight Club, Pretty Women,Vanilla Sky, The Breakfast Club, Hideous Kinky (although the book is better), Ferris Buellers day off, Autumn in New York, Mistress of Spices, Splash, Scent of a Women, When Harry met Sally, Sleepless in Seattle, Notting Hill I could go on and on and on....but I won't!!!! Some of my favourite books are, 365 Bedtime Stories, Harry Potter, Pomegranate soup, Julie / Julia Project, Hideous Kinky, Dinner with a perfect Stranger, The Tao of Pooh, this list really could go on and on and become endless as I am an avid reader. I have been a member of zaar's since May 2002 and have loved every minute of it, I just know that if I need a recipe you guys will have it! I haven't posted many recipes yet but I just love it when I receive a review. This is why I always review all the zaar recipes I try, I also try to photograph as many as possible too!

My life consists of school, work, and theatre. Moving to a new town and a new school half way through high school turned out to be a great event and I am very happy with my new life. I work at Papa Murphy's Take and Bake Pizza and absolutely love my job. It is the perfect job for me at this point in time. Since the town is pretty small, the shop has become a favorite and we have lots of regular customers which is awesome. If you haven't ever had Papa Murphy's before then you should most definitely try it because it is the closest you can get to homemade pizza without making it at home! As a first hand source, I can tell you that the dough is all made, cheese shredded, and veggies cut all in-store. My favorites are the Papa's favorite, gourmet veggie, and cheesy bread! I just love experimenting and creating new tasty combinations, but I also get to take home the mess-ups:) I have already decided that I want to be a diner owner and baker or someday (or something along those lines). I don't know if I'll get there, but that's what I wanna do. My mom has taught me everything I know, she supports me, and she always makes sure I'm happy. I could never thank her enough for what she has done for me. I also watch TV, not much, but there are a few shows that I absolutely have to watch (American Idol though it's over now and Hell's Kitchen). I also love Food Network and HGTV! I love Christmas, Thanksgiving, and Easter; mainly because those are the 3 holidays that my entire family gets together on and they're the big food holidays. I'm also very lucky because I have already traveled a lot inside the country mainly, but I have been to 3 of the islands in the Caribbean and Mexico. My absolute favorite places so far are California, Mexico, the Bahamas, Florida, Virginia, Colorado, and Oklahoma. When traveling, I love anything outdoors; skiing, the beach, amusement parks, national parks (Yosemite, Mesa Verde!). I used to think my mom was trying to make our summer vacations all 'educational', and now I can see that she WAS trying to teach us something, but I look back on those times and realize how great the places were. Williamsburg in Virginia and Eureka Springs in Arkansas are two of the cutest towns I have ever seen!

I didn't have any so he gave me his and I was happy to get them!8-) We have two other boys, JJ and Andy who are a daschund and a maltese respectively. JJ left us to go to doggy heaven in 2004. Now we have another Maltese and her name is Keisha. I usually call her ""Keter-bug"". I worked with developmentally delayed individuals in a state Human Development Center for 12 years and wouldn't change it for anything else. My favorite cookbook would have to be Joy of Cooking because it's like a Cook's Bible...if you can't find something anywhere else you will find it in there. I don't use it all the time but if I have a question it's the first place I turn. The one I use the most is a Louisiana Junior League cookbook called ""Cotton Country Cooking"". It has everyday food in it that is what we like to eat the most. I've cooked just about anything I can think of from lobster to raccoon. We even cooked turtle. The thing that I really get peeved about is when people try to be someone they aren't. If you are just yourself you'll come a lot nearer to being who you want to be which is probably accepted and liked by all. I'd like to go to Europe if I had a month off.

I might add a couple notes or links to my page here such as forums I frequent, fave searches, and helpful info. Update March 2008: I was given the opportunity to join my very first recipe swap (I added the banner below, thanks Um Safia) This swap was really fun, interesting, and helpful. Lots of great recipes to choose from and lots of exposure for my own. I thought I'd update this a bit. It's April of 2007 already (wow!) and I might have written the stuff below at least a year ago, and longer. I live in AZ, with a roommate and a nice boyfriend. My roommate has only tried my cooking once, but my bf, bless his heart, tries really hard to tolerate it, lol! He's a good cook in his own right, but me, I'm still a newbie cook at heart. I still enjoy 'zaar and sometimes spend hours and hours on here, as it's still friendly, helpful, and interesting. :) Also, this is late in saying, but I'm supposed to be on an IBS-safe diet consisting of no dairy, egg yolks, caffeine, red meat, too much fat, everything I love, etc.... so I'm working on it, it's taking me years and years, but I've incorporated this kind of diet into my other eating, and if my tummy gets mad at me, well, I only have me to blame. :/ I've been married for almost two years and it's the first time I get to really cook for someone other than myself. (Hehe, I signed up with here not too long after I wrote this, now I'm separated - not because of my cooking lol - but surprisingly found myself again, acting as 'housewife'.) I'm not a great cook, but I do follow after my mother, who tends to estimte her ingredients and taste as she goes, but she and my sister are two of the best cooks I know. The best rule of thumb for seasonings is always add too little, you can always add more, but can't always take away if there's too much. I mostly try other recipes I find, but now and then experiment with whatever I have available if I can't get to the store or am broke, and sometimes come up with pretty good recipes. I also have a hard time cooking usually, it takes me longer than most people as I am legally blind and have no depth perception so sometimes it's hard for me to measure and prepare food. Any of the recipes I post might be estimated unless otherwise stated. Sorry for the inconvenience. :) I found this place doing one of my recipe searches. It looks like a fun place to get recipes.

My favorite cookbook resources are my 'gourmet' sister and the very patient and generous ohana of Zaar … Mahalo nui loa! My rating system: The first time I try a recipe, I follow the instructions as given; if I do a little tweaking, I keep that in mind when rating. It's not right to rate lower because of something I did or didn't do. ***** ... Excellent! Tasted great with/without tweaking. **** ... Loved It! Tasted great with/without tweaking. No stars ... May be an excellent recipe but I was unable to get it to work for me. May or may not try again later. We don't all have the same taste preferences. I've found recipes with lots of five stars that just didn't work for me and some with less that I thought were great.

86383,249519,https://www.food.com/user/249519,Dories Lori,"Hi~ First question – who’s Dorie? Well, she's my mother, and I love her dearly, though she had little to do with my interest in food. See, I just had to come up with a Zaar name, and my little-used ebay moniker popped into my head. I love the 'Zaar and find so much inspiration from the recipies and the friendly community. I love to read recipes and cook, and I am often ""creating"" dishes. Sometimes I read a bunch of recipes about whatever I have in mind, and do things the way I think I would like them. Unfortunately, I usually don't measure, which is too bad, because they often come out great, and I would like to share them. Now that I am hanging out around the 'Zaar, I expect to be measuring more! About reviews - I often don't follow recipes exactly. I look forward to writing about my experience/alterations, though I might not give a rating if my ""altered"" experience is not a fair assessment of the original recipe. I often find the star rankings difficult, but on the new Zaar, they seem to be assigned values, so I plan to use them. And, I want to add how helpful I have found other peoples reviews - I always read them when available. That's what makes this site so helpful! (Second besides the community.) I'll write more about myself some day, and my wonderful relationship with food. OK - it's someday - 2 things come to mind. My favorite way to spend my birthday is to cook and invite people over (if only the house would clean itself - I don't have TIME for that!) I like Cook's Illustrated, and often refer to that while cooking. Sort of like my cooking bible, the first place I look, as a reference. Although, I do not think they are the final word in things. Hey - and now, the Zaar is the first place I usually look :-) Another is that I like to eat everything, but I generally (doesn't that mean >50%) cook healthy. So far, this has meant looking for whole grain recipes, or taking other recipes and making them whole grain. Sometimes with mixed results. Various musings: I'd like to write a cookbook (and get rich from it, too.) I bet lots of people here feel that way. Truthfully, it sounds like a LOT of work. Especially as I am too lazy to measure things. LOL I found a pet peeve - incremental product downsizing! Wreaks havok with recipes, and it is so cheap and annoying to destroy standards. Here is another peeve: the variable heat (capsaiasin?) in jalapenos! Why are some so hot, and the next one is so mild??? It is so hard to control the heat in dishes that way. Just can't tell from the outside. Well, Grrr... AND I SPEND WAY TOO MUCH TIME ON THE 'ZAAR! :-) I played Pick-a-Chef Fall '06, and now I get to display these fun banners!",Contributor,4.7,,2005-10-01,4,2,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/taco.png,9455

We have 4 children and 3 grandchildren. I have worked for a pasta company for a good number of years - very proud of the hard work everyone has done to grow this company that began as a farmer owned co-operative. If you buy the store branded pasta at a chain grocery store in the US, there's a very good possibility you have eaten pasta made in ND. We also make a lot of pasta for a good number of chain restaurants you may have eaten at. I very much enjoy cooking and baking. I find Zaar to be a plethora of interesting and smart people willing to share not only recipes, but a lot of knowledge that help me grow my own skills, tempts me into trying new things and help in making better choices. I also enjoy reading and sewing (quilting mostly) and a little gardening. Trying to learn knitting - my granddaughter, who is six, has asked for a sweater. I figure if I start on an adult sweater now, I might have one done for her when she graduates high school! Recipe rating I use (borrowed from Tish's page) 5 stars - This recipe is perfect. I would recommend it to others and would definitely make again. 4 stars - This recipe was good but I would change something in it next time. 3 stars - This is a recipe I would not make again but it was ""OK"" 2 stars - This recipe I would not make again and we didn't like it at all 1 star - This recipe did not work out/taste was unappealing and I wouldn't make it again",Contributor,,USA,2003-04-01,14,0,"http://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/h_120,w_160,c_fill,q_92/v1/avatars/21_medthumb_hor.gif",2719

86444,182010,https://www.food.com/user/182010,Chef Kate,"I have always loved to cook. When I was little, I cooked with my Grandmother who had endless patience and extraordinary skill as a baker. And I cooked with my Mother, who had a set repertoire, but taught me many basics. Then I spent a summer with a French cousin who opened up a whole new world of cooking. And I grew up in New York City, which meant that I was surrounded by all varieties of wonderful food, from great bagels and white fish to all the wonders of Chinatown and Little Italy, from German to Spanish to Mexican to Puerto Rican to Cuban, not to mention Cuban-Chinese. And my parents loved good food, so I grew up eating things like roasted peppers, anchovies, cheeses, charcuterie, as well as burgers and the like. In my own cooking I try to use organics as much as possible; I never use canned soup or cake mix and, other than a cheese steak if I'm in Philly or pizza by the slice in New York, I don't eat fast food. So, while I think I eat and cook just about everything, I do have friends who think I'm picky--just because the only thing I've ever had from McDonald's is a diet Coke (and maybe a frie or two). I have collected literally hundreds of recipes, clipped from the Times or magazines, copied down from friends, cajoled out of restaurant chefs. Little by little, I am pulling out the ones I've made and loved and posting them here. Maybe someday, every drawer in my apartment won't crammed with recipes. (Of course, I'll always have those shelves crammed with cookbooks.) I'm still amazed and delighted by the friendliness and the incredible knowledge of the people here.

I did spend three months renovating the kitchen and it is very retro. It is bigger than the hobbit house kitchen, but still small. I also finished another degree - this time in small business and am now currently working full time on my small mobile art business. I sometimes miss working with the elderly as a mental health therapist, but for the time being I am doing what I had always wanted to do for many years. Plus I am enjoying fixing up my new old house. 1/1/11 - Just a quick update on my profie, considering its been a few years since I updated. I still love to cook and we are currently looking for a new house, preferably another old house, but one with a larger kitchen. I have recently had some GI issues which are causing me to look differently at food. In the next few months you will start to see me post some new recipes that will be good, healthy and appropriate to those who suffer from digestive problems and IBS. I live in Michigan at this time, but have lived in several different states and countries. I like to cook and have recently been striving to cook healthy. I am an artist and therapist by profession. I enjoy walking, reading and making cards. I am also presently working on another degree to add to my collection of two bachelors and two masters degrees. The latest challenge is an online degree in small business management. I believe I probably cook in one of the smallest kitchens around. We live in an official bungalow, is even listed on the national registry. However, bungalow must mean very small, we nicknamed our house the hobbit house. The kitchen is equipped with a 1929 mini stove, limited pot space on the stove. We recently got a new refrigerator - almost standard size, except shorter - the old coil on the outside one died. I have so little room, I store the majority of my cooking items and can goods in the basement. My challenge is to be the best chef I can, despite my cooking environment. Some day I will have my dream kitchen, in the meantime, it is a snap to reach from the sink, to the stove, to the frig.!",Contributor,4.7,212,2008-03-01,0,18,https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/q_92/v1/food_avatar/780172/6bvkPmZ5SMCWOdz9hlX2-IMG_0448.jpg,1992

Maxx was the best dog that anyone could ever hope to have in their life.  Until we meet again, sweet boy, you will be forever in my heart and memories. I currently live in the country with two dogs (a 12 pound poodle mix named Suki and a new member to the family, a 7-month old(?) 7.5 pound terrier mix named Angel ).   I got Angel from the dog pound a week after I lost my beloved Maxx.  Suki and I both needed a new companion to help us cope with our loss.  Nothing will ever replace Maxx, but she has helped to uplift Suki's spirit. I am a secretary for a county school board. I love to cook, bake, crochet, paint, sew, read and anything to do with crafts. I was born in Tokyo,Japan. My father was in the Air Force and my moher was Japanese. I love to cook (and eat) a variety of foods from many different nations. I especially like trying out new recipes and experimenting with both old and new recipes. I also love participating in the great Zaar events like the tag games, recipe swaps, and Zaar World Tours. I recently participated in my first RSC contest. I have definitely had a lot of fun since joining Recipezaar.

Anyway, as to my years in the State Park System (retired now), I was responsible for 4 restaurants/dining rooms on my park and my boss at Central Headquarters said I should spend less time in my kitchens and more time tending to my park budget. I spent 25 years in those kitchens and worked with some really great chefs over those years, (and some really awful ones too!) I spent THOUSANDS of hours on every inch of that park and adjacent state forest (60,000 acres) and sometimes I miss it. But mostly I miss being in that big beautiful resort lodge kitchen. I miss my little marina restaurant down on the Ohio River too. I served the best Reuben Sandwich (my own recipe -- posted on 'Zaar as The Shawnee Marina Reuben Sandwich) in both the State of Ohio and the Commonwealth of Kentucky down there and sold it for $2.95. Best deal on the river! They (friends and neighbors) call my kitchen The Ospidillo Cafe. Don't ask me why because it takes about a case of beer, time-wise, to explain the name. Anyway, it's a small galley kitchen with a Mexican motif (until my wife catches me gone for a week or so), and it's a very BUSY kitchen as well. We cook at all hours of the day and night. You are as likely to see one of my neighbors munching down over here as you are my wife or daughter. I do a lot of recipe experimentation and development. It has become a really fun post-retirement hobby -- and, yes, I wash my own dishes. Also, I'm the Cincinnati Chili Emperor around here, or so they say.

The baby in the icon is my 4 year old grandson, Oliver. The pic is me on my 59th b'day, my husband gave me those gorgeous pearls and we had a great evening. I also must mention the other lover in my life the very hairy, extemely beautiful, totally black cat named Spike; actually he is afraid of his own shadow so we gave him a tough guy name. One of my sons was a soldier in the Canadian military. I pray for all of our children who so bravely defend our way of life. I try to do something kind everyday. It really is nice to be nice. I detest pettiness, two faced people and dishonesty. I try to treat everyone I touch with the same respect I would like. Also I try not to sweat the small stuff.

Lolo used to make pickle fish. You would think that is a kids worst nightmare, but it was fabulous. I would kill for that recipe.My mother was also a wonderful cook. I grew up eating the most amazing food; her lasagna and Bolognese sauce are out of this world. I am originally from Argentina and living in Colorado for the past 25 years. As you can imagine, I love to cook, eat and entertain. I read cookbooks like novels. There is nothing that I enjoy more than traveling. I love the challenge of a new culture and a foreign language. Of course all my traveling is culinary oriented. Eventually I would love to move to Italy. Italians, in my opinion, have the perfect life style; Hard work in the morning, good food for lunch, nice siesta and out for a ""giro"" (go for a round) in the afternoons to visit with your friends over a cup of coffee. My daughter is a great baker; she has a natural talent for it. We can make the exact same recipe and hers ALWAYS tastes much better.

86641,2597942,https://www.food.com/user/2597942,rosie316,"(FYI Update: 06/03/14)... My About Me page is correct. I joined as a member on March 19, 2012 (2+ years ago). But if you click on my public recipes, it states that I joined on Dec 29, 2112. It's way off... but I'm sure the staff will take care of this issue soon. (I will remove this when this error has been corrected). Anyway...   Hi fellow chefs. Looking to expand here. Everyone on here has been a pleasure to meet & share recipes with. My hubby and I live in Northern Illinois USA, just NW of Chicago. I'm a very proud mom of 2 kids (my daughter in college & my son in highschool). I also have 4 semi step-children, from which we are now proud grandparents of a 4th grandchild (June 2013). I love to cook and experiment (using my family & friends as guinea pigs). If I had the time and $$$, I would spend all of it on creating dishes to feed people. I try to have family and neighbors over whenever possible to feed them. I've cooked many large meals (at home) to take to our county's women/children's shelter, and also to the homeless men that spend 1 night, (once a week), in the local church basement. It's the right thing to do (when you can afford to do it). I love to throw a party, even when it isn't a holiday. Cookouts in the summer or a bring a dish to pass type of get together or an appetizer only event, or even a fondue party. But my favorite... a rolling dinner party ... that's when each of our neighbors who participate pick a dish, and we walk to their home to have cocktails at house #1, then on to house #2 for appetizers, then house # 3 for soup & salad, house # 4 is the entree, and finally house # 5 is dessert! Now keep in mind, we take house #1's cocktails with us when we go on to the next few houses! LOL It's alot of fun. Try it sometime. We usually do it the weekend before Christmas and then go caroling the neighborhood. It's hilarious... grown adults, with full bellys, withstanding temps in the single digits, singing to the community! Sorry folks, I tend to ramble. Anyway, in any spare time, I love to garden. Flowers, veggies and herbs. Always planting in the spring/summer when I can. My bucket list includes making a Moon Garden. Not the kind that some farmers use as a planting chart, but a garden containing flowers, herbs and veggies that are white or somewhat white in color, and they glow beautifully under the moonlight!  Hubby and I are caretakers for a little cabin, up north of us, in Wisconsin. It is truely a thing to see. Located on 40 acres (formerly a paper mill plantation). Huge pine trees abound and so very peaceful. The downside is... NO electricity and NO running water. That's correct... we literally have an outhouse (like a skinny, wooden shed with a hole beneath it and a crescent moon cut in the door). Ewww. Sorry. We use propane to grill with, and have a oil burning stove in the little 2 room cabin. We also use a charcoal grill or our wood smoker, on which we make a brisket every time we go up there. Another favorite thing to make are Pudgie Pies using cast iron pie irons over the open firepit!... Google them... they are fun and tasty! We also have a trailer set up for the youngsters that has a propane stovetop and oven. And when we go in the summer, there is a farm stand just 15 minutes away that we can get fresh produce from. It's great! And luckily, the public lake (2nd largest in Wisconsin) is only 20 minutes away. They have a beach with restrooms and showers. It's a blast going there. We take the kids and grandkids with on occasion and have a great time! We love to ATV around the trails on those 40 acres of heaven. Okay, on we go...I have been working independently as an owner/operator of a pet grooming salon for 20 plus years, which is why I now have a Chinese Crested dog, (pretty much hairless, so basically, no real grooming involved). We also have a cat, 4 ducks & drakes, and 2 chickens. Oh... and a $0.15 cent goldfish that I bought from the pet store, because he was too cute to be in the stores feeder fish tank. The old one lived 3 yrs and had passed, and grand-babies missed seeing him. I got a new one. The new one with us still doesn't have a name.  So, there you  have it... thats me. -Rosie My rating/review system is as follows: 5 stars - Excellent, as is. Would not change a thing. 4 stars - Very good, liked by most. 3 stars - Good, but needs to be altered on some things. 2 stars -  It could have potential, but not for me. 1 star - Will not attempt again. 0 stars - I only post a reply without stars to comment, as I do not want to mess up someone's rating.",Contributor,4.9,212,2012-12-01,2,14,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/sushi.png,1041

I feel very strongly about food and how it affects us...I think of it as medicine...the food you eat can be just as effective for the maintenance of your health as any prescription drug! And who wouldn't want to use nutrition as a way to avoid disease so that you end up taking less pills later in life? Health was my motivation for giving up dairy and eggs...and, although I don't make it a habit to go around shouting at people that they should eat this and avoid that, it does make me happy when people make the right choices for their health! Hmmmmm. pet peeves? If I had a dollar for every time since I gave up meat that someone asked me, ""Well, what DO you eat, anyway?"" I could retire to a tropical island! I guess it bothers me that people are so ignorant of the choices that are available to them. And it shocks me that there are people out there who have no clue how to read a label, deciding whether something has too much fat or sodium (or whatever) for them to consume! I knew a woman who thought her potato chips were healthy because ""it said no trans-fats"" on the bag! I always dreamed of becoming a dietician so I could help that kind of person, but have been disinclined to pursue it because of the time to earn the degree, the low pay most of them receive and the general feeling that no one will listen to me, anyway! For fun, I like to hang out with my dogs, cook for people (especially veg people!), read, make jewelry, watch British comedy on TV, go out shopping with friends at places like junk stores and ethnic markets, and tons of other stuff! I stay pretty busy! Fave restaurant...Sage in Chapel Hill...if you live around here, I encourage you to check it out! Beautiful food, great atmosphere, even if it is on the small side, and the proprietor is the most gorgeous man! And everything on the menu is vegetarian or vegan...I feel so free when I walk in there...it's amazing! For food shopping, I like Whole Foods the best. Trader Joe's is not as veg friendly, but they have good prices on many staples that I use. Some of the mainstream stores are even catching on...we have a Food Lion near us way out here in the boonies that has a whole natural foods area that allows me to purchase many vegan specialty items without making a long drive to town! Love that! Amazon.com is great for non-perishable foods...they have that subscribe and save program for many grocery items and it is a real savings!

Pet Peeve: People with a negative attitude. MY RATING SYSTEM: 5 stars - Excellent in taste. May have minor change. 4 stars - Adjustment in ingredients for flavor. 3 stars - Fair, but not sure whether I would repeat. 2 and 1 stars - I do NOT give.

86744,52448,https://www.food.com/user/52448,PetsRus,"Hello, my name is Bonnie and I am a very beautiful cat as you can see if you look at the picture at the top of this page.... What??.. I am supposed to talk about you??? But it says here: About Me!! Well all right then ...... My mom is Dutch and has moved to England in October 2007, after living 15 years in the Netherlands with my English dad. They don’t have any human children and “created” their own family, which means I have to share them with Hannah, she is a 6 years old tortie cat, Abby the dog, she is a 9 year old Beagle, and a one year old black Miniature Pincher named Poppy, I refuse to tell you my age but I am a georgious lilac British Shorthair cat!! It is obvious she adores pets just by looking at her name she uses on Zaar (many on Zaar call her Pets or Petsie Poo), her name in real life is Annelies and that is a common Dutch name. My mom always liked to cook, but since she joined Zaar it got out of control, and it doesn’t help that she is disorganized. Printed recipes everywhere in the house, the recipe binders have got bigger and just between you and me, her hips too!!! I have lived in Holland all of my life until now, but they lived in several different countries/places:- desert and coastal Oman, up North and West in Holland, Vancouver-Canada, Aberdeen- Scotland and in Norway they lived in Bergen and Oslo. We have all moved together to England, as you can see I’ve already learnt the language! I heard her say to Dad that this is the last time she moved to another country...she's had it with moving from one place to another! ( its her age...she's getting grumpy) Mom is 55 years old but I always hear her say that the date of her birthday does not mean that much to her, the date of her cancer anniversary is more important, because so far she is a survivor. Besides cooking she has other interests too, crafts, gardening and soap making. She likes Zaar and is one of the hosts on the German-Benelux Forum here on RecipeZaar. She would like to thank everybody who tries and comments on the recipes she has posted on Recipezaar, your feedback is very much appreciated.",Contributor,4.7,"Leiden, Zuid Holland",2002-08-01,8,59,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/burger.png,2249

My other half calls me his 1950's housewife because I just love to bake, preserve and cook in general! After studying catering at college I decided commercial cookery wasn't for me but I still like nothing more than discovering new dishes, throwing dinner parties and so on! I work on the recruitment side of a quantity surveying consultancy about 25 miles north of London. I love my job. It's hard work but fast paced, challenging and my work day just flies by. With regards to how I rate recipes, I try and keep it fair and to the system. I do my best to give no lower than 3 stars but will do on occasion if I made something as directed and it still ended up in the bin. I've never given 1 star but on occasion I'll leave no stars if I suspect something went horribly wrong. Most recipes get rated at 3/4 stars because 5 stars is reserved for spectacular recipes that become frequent users and a family favourite. Everyone has their own rating systems and that doesn't offend me. Rate my recipes as you see fit - I know what I like and what I don't and I'm here to fill my recipe book (filling anyone elses is merely an advantage), not to win a popularity competition or become chef of the year.",Contributor,4.6,,2006-11-01,4,21,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pie.png,674

I've always loved to cook for family and friends.  Back in the States, had a cookbook collection to rival any library, but sadly had to leave them behind when we moved here.  Fortunately, I'm discovering that all my favorite cookbook recipes are already somewhere on the inernet, so it's not so bad after all! Most of the time, I look at recipes just to get ideas and then go with it from memory or what's in the pantry.  Hubby is a great cook, too - and we make a wide variety of foods.  We especially love italian, greek, and mexican cuisines. Here in Costa Rica, it's difficult to find many of the foods we're accustomed to.  So I've learned to make many of the basics we used to take for granted, like ricotta cheese, hummus, tahini, teriyaki sauce, Rose's lime juice, and many liqueurs.  Thanks, Food.com for making my search for recipes easier!

I have also been very fortunate to have travelled extensively over the years.........I still have wanderlust! I used to be an English Literature & Art History teacher & lecturer; before that, I trained and worked as a Graphic Designer for many years. I now live in France with my husband & my daughter who has just started university in September 2006. We also have one very chatty Burmese cat Willow, who allows us to live with her here! (I used to have three cats, I recently lost Monty, a beautiful seal point Siamese and before that, Rama, who was a debonair blue point Siamese cat - I would love to have another Siamese cat or cats in the future!)

I love all types of cuisine, but especially Traditional British - and NO it is NOT all bad!!

I also enjoy French & North African cuisine, come to think of it, there isn't much I don't like!

Our home is completely furnished with Antique French furniture that we have rescued & restored ourselves. Our charming village has one of the oldest Churches in the region & it is famous for its connection with the St.Jacques de Compostella Pilgrimage route, as well as being within the Cognac & Bordeaux wine growing area. We have a wonderful garden where we grow ALL of our own herbs and most of our fruit and vegetables. I specialise in rare, unusual and old-fashioned herbs, which I grow in our walled garden. As well as growing herbs, I also grow many different varieties of lavender, old-fashioned shrub roses and heirloom fruit and vegetables. We have lived overseas for many, many years now - but we both still love going home to Northern England, near Scarborough & York, to visit our family & friends. We also love indulging in dining out when we are there, in a wide variety of EXCELLENT Gastro-Pubs that we have in North Yorkshire; and popping in to have a Pint of REAL ENGLISH ALE in our local pub is a always a must!!

I do appreciate your comments. My pet peeves about cooking are recipe reviews where the reviewer says, ""I made the recipe exactly as written EXCEPT yada yada yada"" and I don't like suggestive names or titles such as, ""Better Than Sex"". I don't know why anyone would eat anything that is 'sinful' or 'decadent' since decadent is described as being decaying. Also, PAP-RI-KA only has 3 syllables. VINAIGRETTE is pronounced vin-a-grette, not vinager-ette. It's mas-car-pone not mars-ca-pone. And I don't like cutesy adult baby talk,,, or metro chic names like delish, nutrish, yummo, sammy, BAM! Oh well, I make as many, or more, faux pas as the next guy especially in ASL!

I just graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Human Nutritional Sciences in May 2008 after 5 years of hard work. My hard work paid off as I was accepted to a post graduate dietetic internship which I am currently completing and will be done in June. The internship allows me achieve professional designation as a registered dietitian. This is a very exciting but also a very busy time for me so I have not been contributing to zaar nearly as much as i'd like to. I have always loved baking and cooking and looking for healthier recipes or ways to make recipes healthier to fit into my lifestyle. I am pesco-vegetarian as I do not want animals to suffer for my consumption. I also love to be active in individual sports and train year round for triathlon. I am both an active racer and volunteer. The distance I prefer most is the Sprint distance - 750m swim, 20km bike, 5km run. This upcoming race season marks my 16th year of participating in triathlon. I love it just as much, if not more, than I did 16 years ago!! I also have a newfound love for Iyengar yoga. I have a profound love for animals and the pretty little kitty you see as my icon is my 16 1/2 year old cat Snuggles. Sadly, Snug passed away in March 2006, and is dearly, dearly missed.

86905,579298,https://www.food.com/user/579298,Peachie Keene,"In An American in Paris starring Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron, Gene Kelly’s character quite convincingly describes his love interest, Leslie Caron. Leslie dances away in a beautiful portrayal of a multifaceted, everyday sorta girl. Like Leslie Caron, I wear numerous hats. Some look better on me than others, but it’s still fun to try them all on! I live incessantly and I am wild, simple and beautiful, spiritual, exciting, lusty, sweet & shy, old fashioned, infectious & modern, yacky and moody. A little bit of everything all rolled into one. It can be difficult to sum up 25 years in a short biography. But it is interesting to look back and mull over the trials and tribulations I have gone through, the extent of how I have changed, the friends I have lost and the companions I have gained… I certainly never expected to wish I could be 12 again, or better yet, wish I had listened to my parents when they said things like ‘save your money’ or ‘do as I say, not as I do’. Because of this I try to live everyday knowing ‘I’m going to miss this’. Not remembering the past or worrying about the future but being present in the moment. In May of 2008 my husband (and high school sweetheart) and I adopted our puppy Kaya, and in August 2008 we gave birth to our first child. My definitions of love and happiness considerably changed the moment I first saw my son. The first few minutes of his brand new life created a new significance to ‘love at first sight’. I now know how it really feels to love somebody. I like to think that I can roll with the punches and blend in where needed. I route for Michigan football year after year (not the most exciting thing to mention right now), I’ve been known to kick some butt on Halo 3, I fired my first shotgun when I was 8 months pregnant and I get excited when I see snakes (but I freak out when I see roaches). Among the more boring traits, I enjoy reading anything from Harry Potter (yea, I know) to John Grisham. I should be a sales rep for Netflix, I’m their #1 fan. Oh, who started the rumor 'the way to a man’s heart is through his stomach' - I beg to differ! I am in no way a man, and I'd prefer a nice meal over flowers any day! I am terribly allergic to cats… and I prefer dogs over diamonds too. I am a stay-at-home-mom and presently I am attending college courses online: I will be graduating with an Associates Degree in Communications in July 2010. I love to write and look forward to making a career of it. I am also intrigued with the process of holistic living; perhaps a career within the realm of holistic health and nutrition would be a suitable addition to my studies :D",Contributor,4.9,212,2007-09-01,1,7,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/fruit-kebab.png,2576

I recently married and I try to cook dinner for my husband and I at least 6 times a week, which he heartily supports. When I'm not cooking or browsing through cookbooks from the library or second-hand store, I can usually be found knitting something, playing video games with DH, or just watching tv. I also love exploring the great outdoors, whether it be hiking, kayaking, biking, or just doing a little sightseeing around town.

I love to travel... sometimes just to pick a spot on the map and make a weekend out of it. Since I have been here, some of my favorite places to visit are Oregon and Washington (Cle Elum, Leavenworth, Spokane, Bonney Lake, Maple Valley, Issaquah, etc). My favorite place in Seattle is Pike Place Market, even though I don't get there often. And, Mt. Rainier is a scene I often photograph.

We've been married for seven wonderful years (March 17, 2001). We don't have any children except our 2 dogs which think they are human and run the house.

I'm saving five stars for the kind of dish you wish that there were 10 stars for... the kind of dish that you'd happily eat every day for 6 days in a row, that wouldn't be out of place coming from the kitcken of an excellent professional chef...or a more humble meal that's so popular that I'd get lynched if I didn't make it once per month (or more often) or which people ask for as a gift for their Birthday. 4 Stars = an excellent dish, but without the mega Wow factor... these are culinary delights that you'd enjoy often, but maybe not every month. These are recipes that you like & love but haven't quite reached the adore catagory. These are recipes that are earthly delights, but seperated from the heavenly delighful ones in the five star group. Nothing wrong with any recipe that gets my four star vote, I assure you. 3 Stars = recipes where some of my human guinea pigs were wildly divided in their ratings. Personal preference is a very tricky area, the distinct taste of various herbs, spices, vegetables, meats and their combinations is something that dosn't necessarily please everyone. If I award three stars then probably your favourite flavours just didn't match our favourite tastes or not enough of us liked it over all. Maybe this something that we all enjoyed, but comes into the catagory of would love this just several times a year Maybe I just couldn't replicate every single ingredient and this affected the result. If any of this is the case and the votes are split then I will aways give your recipe the benifit of the doubt and go for the higher star rating of the group.. and I'll let you know details in my review. 2 Stars = for whatever reason this recipe just didn't do it for us, flavours clashed, the flavour promised didn't deliver or something just plain went wrong. If you are receiving a two star review from me that please know that if the ingredients aren't too expensive, that I tired your recipe again with a few tweeks in the hope that I could modify it to suit us better (since there obviously was something in your recipe that caught my eye in the first place. Two stars means that the second attempt didn't work out either. I would try and tell you in detail what I had a problem with, and I'd try to do that as tactfully as possible. I'd hope you wouldn't throw your rolling pin at me for it 1 Star = give us food poisioning or put us in hospital with your recipe and it receives one star in a flash. (please know I am very careful when storing/preparing/cooking food) I take the health and wellbeing of my family and friends very seriously indeed. We will try very very hard to never have a one star review, yes? that would make both you and me very very very happy.

We like to try new recipes and Recipezaar has made this easy for us. When we first met he moved to Alaska, and to bridge the distance we would cook (him in Alaska and me in Alabama) the exact same recipe from zaar while on the phone or web cam together. When we had more time we tried at least one new recipe a week. We are slowly but surely getting back to that tradition. Cooking together has become challenging with a 13 month old.

I even appreciate the ones that tried them and for some reason they didn't work out for you.  Everyone has different tastes, and you can't please everyone all the time.   Lots of times people change the recipes, adding things, leaving things out, and not seasoning them to their own taste, and give a bad review...  Recipes are only guidelines, and if you follow mine and don't like it, then it's a personal preference as to why you don't like it, and I appreciate that.  However, if you don't follow my recipe then it is YOUR recipe that you don't like, and my recipe shouldn't be rated. IMHO   Thanks for trying them anyway  :) Hugs, Linda   My name is Linda. I am happily single, and I live in Rochester NH. I just moved back to the town where most of my family lived years ago, and where I lived as a child, after living in NC for 5 years. I have 2 grown sons, a dil, and 2 beautiful grandsons. I really enjoy my time here on Zaar posting recipes, trying new recipes, taking pictures, and reviewing lots of yummy recipes! I love to cook, and share recipes. The recipes that I share are mainly my own creations, or family recipes passed down to me from my mom and grandmother, and other family members or friends. If I post something from somewhere else, it has to sound REALLY good to me for me to post it! Many of the dishes that I prepare are simple, good, down home cooking. Many of them originate from New England, as my grandmother is from Maine, and my mother from New Hampshire. I do also like to try making some gourmet recipes as well, using my creativity along the way. I started cooking at a the age of 8, helping my mother and grandmother in the kitchen. My curiosity for cooking has led me to create many of my own recipes through trial and error. I hope you enjoy them as much as my family and I do :) In my spare time I play on my computer collecting recipes, and have been working on creating a cookbook to publish for some time, but have put it aside for now. I also love to travel and shop. I love to go to the beach and mountains, and as food is a passion of mine, I love to dine out and try many different cuisines in the area, and with friends when I am traveling :) I made my first herb garden in 2008, but have had vegetable gardens for many years in the past. I have done my share of canning and I love those fresh herbs and veggies all summer long! My Rating System: 5 Stars ***** Outstanding recipe that I absolutely loved. It can be down home or restaurant quality, as long as it tastes great and I didn't have to make any changes along the way! Also recipe has to have clear directions. One I would definately make again and again. 4 Stars **** Great recipe that I loved, but one that I may have had to tweak just a bit. Directions may have not been crystal clear. One I would make again and again with my changes. 3 Stars *** I liked the recipe, but had to add ingredients, or add more of a called for ingredient to have the recipe come out the way I like it. I would probably make again sometime. 2 Stars ** This recipe was ok, but I probably wouldn't make it again due to lack of taste, undesireable texture, or unclear directions etc. 1 Star * This recipe was one I didn't like at all. Either the amounts of ingredients were wrong (too little flavor or too much of one/some of the ingredients in the recipe), or the recipe didn't come out right following the directions given. Lack of directions.

I preferred baking over cooking, as I loved getting all into measuring things and stirring. I always got to stir! However in the past 5 years I've been the one responsible for making nightly dinners. At first this consisted of the same 10 or so dishes in a constant rotation, but that quickly became boring and I remembered how much my Mom would complain when I was younger about how she always made the same things and she never knew what new dishes to try! Obviously 20 years ago, Zaar wasn't around! I still cook a lot of the same type of dishes my Mom cooked when we were younger and I try to incorporate as much fresh fruit, vegetables, and herbs into my meals as possible.

I've only been cooking for a few years now, but there are already quite a few people whom I have surpassed. Interestingly enough, I tell people it's not necessarily that I'm a good cook per se, just that I know how to pick the right recipes. This is why I stick around here. :) I am a recent college graduate, a finance major. I'm not quite sure exactly where this path will take me, but hopefully, if I'm good enough at it (and if the economy permits), maybe to an early retirement. :D My Rating System 5 stars: WOW! You don't have to have a recipe for the best thing I've ever tasted to get a 5 as long as there is something about it that honestly impresses me. 4 stars: I give four stars to recipes that are really good but have one thing or two that I would change. 3 stars: I give 3 stars to recipes that I feel are ""average"" or about the same quality as the everyday stuff my mom or I would make before I started looking for the best recipes on Zaar. 2 stars: I will probably never give a 2 star rating. If I feel your recipe was a 2-star, it is below average but not bad enough for me to tell you so. Thus, I might just never rate it. 1 star: Means the recipe had something significantly wrong with it that I believe others should be warned of. NOTE: Sometimes I will give extra stars on top of how I think the food tasted if I believe the lack of quality was due in part to a blunder of mine.",Contributor,4.5,,2008-05-01,0,12,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/taco.png,6

I started cooking when I was very young and have fond memories of a kindergarten field trip to a maple farm where we got some sap and took it back to school and boiled it down to make maple syrup. Then we mixed up some pancakes and each got a little dab of the syrup on our pancake. I am the oldest child and always helped my mother in the kitchen and could cook in elementary school. I have lived in New England all my life and love it! Western Massachusetts where I live is so beautiful and close enough to the other beautiful New England states and New York so that day trips and weekends in lovely old and new spots are always possible. I especially like to travel to Maine, Cape Cod, and Vermont. Being in New England means that you can be in the mountains or at the beach within an hour or two to enjoy the bounty that the New England harvest and catches provide. I collect cookbooks and my children probably think that I have too many. I love to try out new recipes and my children, twins Tatiana and William, and their little brother, Jared are willing mixers and taste testers. I enjoy all types of ethnic cuisines and love to experiment with different herbs and spices. When I am not cooking and transporting my children to activities from ballet to soccer,I teach at a graduate school. I enjoy teaching and learning, and I am thinking about going to get another graduate degree. src=http://i68.photobucket.com/albums/i25/bayhill/Zaar%20Icons%20and%20Greetings/gs2009jane.jpg>",Contributor,4.4,212,2003-11-01,1,1,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/burger.png,2808

We are currently house hunting and a dishwasher is a must (we don't have one right now). Luckily my dh is pretty good about helping out with the dishes :) I know it seems like I give lots of good reviews, but there is a good reason: I know what we like, so I pick dishes I think we will like, and often we do. If i give a review of a recipe with no stars it's because I think I did something wrong usually so that's why it didn't come out right. Or if something has excellent ratings and I don't like it, I don't want to ruin that, because obviously I didn't like something, but that's not a refection of the actual recipe! I dislike when people don't make the recipe correctly and give it a bad review. Ok, if you change one or two small things, fine, but if you make major changes, not ok. And when people give a bad review because it was good, but not what they are looking for? Sorry, but I don't get that. YOU picked it, if it tastes good but wasn't what you were looking for, not the recipe's fault :)",Contributor,4.5,,2007-01-01,0,9,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pop.png,1896

I've since moved to the east coast to a small village in Northern Virginia - a huge change! We moved here mainly so we could live in an area better suited to raising children and closer to family. Although it's an adjustment, we really love it here. My husband and I were married in Feb 2003 and had our first daughter, Kylie, in Aug 2004. Our second daughter, Katie, was just born in July 2006. I was an HR Director until I became Mom, and I wouldn't trade this job for anything in the world! I began cooking when I became a stay-at-home-mom, mostly out of necessity. We used to eat out for every meal...and I do mean EVERY meal. When our income was cut in half after my ""early retirement"", eating out was no longer an option. Therefore, if I was going to continue to eat all the delicious food I was accustomed to, I was going to have to...oh, the horror!!!...COOK IT MYSELF!!! I had grown up baking with my mom, but hadn't actually baked in years and had always left the cooking to her. To my utter surprise and delight (not to mention my husband's SHOCK and delight)...I loved it!

I've never seen anything like it and it's just wonderful! Notes on my ratings: In terms of cooking skill I rate myself a ""good cook"". In terms of taste, well....I like what I like so it's subjective. (If my picky DH gives something a thumbs up and/or my children also like it - that's a bonus but I rate on my own experience.) When I read a recipe I get a sense of what I THINK it should taste like. If I make the recipe, don't experience any trouble in the making of it, and it tastes like I'm expecting then it's 5 stars. If it tastes like I expect but I had some issue in the making of the recipe, which I will document, then it's 4 stars. 3 stars would mean it's middle of the road. Tasted okay, worked okay, but it didn't set my tongue on fire. 2 stars is going to be an overall disappointment, most likely in taste. 1 star - I hope never to give any recipe 1 star. With luck I would ""know"" that the mix of ingredients or what have you isn't going to work for me.

I work from our home handling all the financial and clerical duties of the business. Over the years and especially since finding Zaar, cooking has become my passion. My grandmothers were very good cooks and I have fond memories of the meals they prepared. We love entertaining and nothing pleases me more than having my family and others enjoy the food I make. I love it when the house smells good with dinner or whatever is baking. I came upon recipezaar searching for a rhubarb cake recipe one day. The recipe I chose was a 5 star and my addiction began. It took a few months before I started really utilizing the site but once I did my cooking has never been the same. My family now knows all about having to rate recipes, picking their favorite chefs, etc. It's become a family thing and they have told me that I may never let my membership to Recipezaar ever end. We love to travel and try to go whenever we can. Owning our own business has helped free up time where we can travel more. We've done some Europe, Canada, and much of the U.S. In the coming years I hope to do a lot more. Eating out when we are traveling is the best. I'm trying to learn more about the restaurants and chefs in places we are visiting so we can try and visit those restaurants and enjoy some of the great places our town just doesn't have.

Community suppers, Beef Pit Barbecues, Church suppers, potlucks, tea and bake sales, booths at the curling and hockey rinks in winter, the ball games in summer. What is truly the spirit of Saskatchewan is that these events are for most part the efforts of community volunteers sharing their time as well as their best make and takes. Small communities along with the larger centres across the province are well known for their turkey suppers, cabbage rolls, perogies and overflowing dessert tables. Homemade of course! I love preparing meals for my family and friends and in the sharing of good recipes be they mine or that of another. My posted recipes are recipes that are family favorites. My reviews here on Zaar allow that I have been most fortunate in the choosing of the recipes I have made.

For me equally important are the recipes used in the daily meal preparation. Recipes enjoyed by my family be it a simple soup, salad or casserole are right up there with the 'over the tops' and share equal billing.

He calls me his Kitchen Witch, because he says that I ""make magic"" in the kitchen.Bert works in Emergency Medicine in a local E.R.(That's what brought us here to New Mexico.) He has worked Emergency for about 27 years now, and I call him my ""working class hero"".(In reference to the John Lennon song.) I have 5 awesome children, 2 step-sons, 2 sons, and a daughter, who because she is the youngest and the only girl, thinks she is a princess.(oh no, she's not spoiled!) I come from a long line of people, on both sides of the family, who were wonderful and creative cooks. I guess that explains my love of cooking and feeding people.I truly get a thrill out of serving food to people who enjoy it.I also love to read, and consume books and information ravenously.I absolutely adore a great mystery.I also would have a hard time surviving without music! I like most all music, from The Beatles, to old Blues(Robert Johnson rocks!) ,to Loreena McKennitt,and Phoebe Snow.I am currently a house wife, due to our recent move.Before that, I worked for several years with abused children in an RTC.(Residential Treatment Center.) My pet peeves are small-minded,prejudiced,mean people and wastefulness. Growing up, my Father taught us that to waste food was a sin when there are so many people in the world starving.I guess that one really stuck with me.I love to meet people with common interests,so Zmail me any time!",Contributor,4.5,,2006-11-01,0,11,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/sushi.png,2470

87464,246844,https://www.food.com/user/246844,little_wing,"I am a single mom of a 15 yr old and work as a CT technologist at hospital and at a cancer facility. I don't see cooking as a chore, I really do enjoy it. I am pretty much teaching myself as I go and have a lot to learn. I need to learn how to choose the right cut of meat. I always hear about how you should make good friends with your butcher. However, I'm afraid of annoying anyone with access to very sharp knives so I always take whatever is wrapped up and ready for sale. Lately, I have been trying to educate myself to be more eco-friendly in the kitchen. The more I learn, the more sense it makes not just for the planet but for my wallet! The hardest part so far has been trying to buy local and what is in season. I was looking at the fish at the seafood counter and everything except for cod had been imported from other countries. Thialand, Vietnam, ect. And all those lovely exotic ingredients in the produce section are very tempting! Another thing that's been frustrating is trying to reduce the amount of packaging my stuff comes in. Why do companies over-package everything?? The composting and recycling are working out great though, and I really encourage people to give it a try. I think a lot of people are reluctant to make greener choices because it seems like a tremendous amount of work and the effort seems overwhelming. But you can just start small. Pick one thing and go for it. Even if you don't make any other changes, you are still doing something! But chances are you will think of one more thing you could be doing. And then one more...it really get addictive because you see how easy it is and you feel good about yourself! For me, it started with just buying one or two reusable shopping bag each week at the grocery store. Within a month or so, I had enough to never need the plastic kind again. I was completely surprised to find that this little change was not only better for the planet, but easier for me! Those bags are so much easier to carry and they hold more stuff so you don't have to make as many trips from the car to the kitchen. Plus, I always have them in my car and use them for all kinds of stuff...carrying my gym clothes, library books, games for roadtrips, ect. Have I sold you on them yet??? My absolute fantasy is to have a farm. I know it will never happen: I have absolutely no connection to farm life and no experience or knowlege to make one succeed. Not to mention, I have no natural talents for any of the skills required to run one. But the idea of living off the land, living simply and being self-sufficient is utterly appealing. I'd love to be able to grow my own food, learn to can and make locally-remarked-upon preserves. Bake bread and pies. Learn to quilt and knit and sew. Feed chickens and gather eggs. Milk cows. Rise and retire with the sun. Sit on my porch at the end of the day and...okay, you get the point. And I realize the reality isn't as romantic as I imagine, but I think it would still be a wonderful way to live. My dream man is a cross between John Walton and Charles Ingalls (too much seventies TV at a young age?) with a bit of Sam Elliot thrown in. Maybe more than a bit! If I ever win the lottery, I think I would quit my job and find work as a farm hand. Of course, that would require me to actually play the lottery. I live with my somewhat idiosyncratic daughter and my reclusive boyfriend. Daughter is very picky, boyfriend will eat anything, but isn't exactly overly effusive either. I, of course, am the normal one. We have some interesting uh...""discussions"". My rating system: To be honest, I never give 2 stars or less because of the chance it was a mistake I made with the recipe. Besides which, I am a coward. In those cases, I just leave a comment with no rating. I also try to save 5 stars for recipes that are truly extraordinary.

87618,573544,https://www.food.com/user/573544,TransplantedHusker,"Greetings from Colorado! I'm originally from Nebraska and moved to Colorado 10 years ago. I'm married to a great guy for 11 years and we have a beautiful daughter who keeps us busy and young! I work as a family law paralegal, specializing in divorces, custody, child support issues. My job can be emotionally demanding but it also helps me to remember to be so very grateful for my marriage and family. I learned to cook from my mom and grandma. I'm the youngest of five kids and my older sisters were both in college by the time I was 5 years old. So I helped Mom a lot fixing supper for my two brothers and Dad. One summer I was obsessed with angel food cake - I think I made at least one (if not 2 or 3!) a week. Angel food with fruit, angel food with frosting, angel food with powdered sugar, angel food tinted with food coloring - I wouldn't recommend this as mine came out looking more like it had been dunked in a paint bucket!! One time my mom was out of town and I made meatloaf for dinner for one brother and my dad. I got everything together and put the meatloaf on a meat rack. To my horror, the meatloaf sank and baked around the meat rake! I was all of 12, maybe 13 and I didn't know what to do. It was my first lesson in the show must go on sometimes and we ate the meatloaf from around the rack. My most notable cooking memory as an adult is when I tried to make a lemon pie - it turned out to be more like lemon soup with the pie crust floating around like crackers!! My dad grabbed a bowl and a ladle and declared it the best lemon dessert soup he'd ever had! My dad passed away in 2002 and you can imagine how much I miss him. Cooking has paid off for me though. The first meal I made for my dh when we were dating was meatloaf (without using a meat rack!) He says that he knew after tasting my meatloaf he'd better marry me quick before I got away...with the recipe!! Just to seal the deal, I also woo'd him with a crockpot pot roast. We were married 9 months later and here we are 11 YEARS later. However, one morning I was running late to work and asked him to throw the pot roast, cream of mushroom soup and onion soup mix in the crockpot. He called me at work that afternoon and asked me what else I had done to the pot roast. I told him I hadn't touched it, was something wrong? Dh told me he has tasted it and it was the most wonderful, out of this world pot roast ever! Then he paused and said, It that ALL you do - just meat, a can of soup and soup mix?!?!?!?! Even I can do that!!! Uh-oh. Our running joke now is that I better hide the meatoaf recipe since he already has the pot roast recipe and if he gets the other, he won't have a reason to stay married to me! LOL Dh also likes to remind him that I really do need him - he does the dishes!!! (Which is more true than I would like to admit!!!)",Contributor,4.6,"Colorado Springs, CO",2007-08-01,6,1,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/face-01.png,7014

Our youngest daughter (and mamma to our five grandchildren) lives in Waverly, NY and decided it was time for us to ""move back up north to be near the grands."" She had a point, so in October of 2016 we moved to Athens. I worked in clerical/secretarial positions in New York State for 30 years before retiring in 2003. Married since 1976, DH and I have been through the war and back in our 41 years together. Now, we're as comfortable with each other and our life together as a pair of well-worn slippers. We have 3 adult children, 5 grandchildren, and a Cockapoo named Sophie Marie. I'm a Certified Lay Minister with American Baptist Churches USA, and just completed a three year course of study from the West Virginia Baptist School of Christian Studies earning a Diploma in Pastoral Ministry. I am passionate about my faith, hope and trust in God. Proverbs 3:5 keeps me grounded. ""Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him and He will make your paths straight."" I'm happiest when I'm free to worship God in spirit and in truth, unhindered by man-made boundaries. Writing creatively and a gift for music, especially singing, are two ways in which I seek to understand, glorify, and praise God for the many blessings of my life. I love: the color green, forests, and long, brown, pine needles; rustic homes and fireplaces; sticking my hands and feet in a cold, clear creek. Children. I love witnessing the innocence of children and grieve when that is taken from them. I have a special place in my heart for the elderly, and I enjoy visiting with them. I find myself humbled and grateful by the life experiences they are so willing to share. I used to bake and cook a lot; but now, arthritis in my hands (especially my thumbs) and feet as well as Fibromyalgia make for less ""kitchen time."" Not a good thing when you enjoy cooking. Now I look for simple and not too time-consuming recipes that still say ""I love you."" I do continue to make halupki, lasagna, and a couple of other time-consuming recipes (although it really tires me out); but, the happy ""thank yous"" from others makes the pain more tolerable. Besides, cooking is about love and pleasing others...not pain.",Contributor,4.7,"Athens, Pennsylvania",2008-11-01,7,18,https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/q_92/v1/food_avatar/40911303/ynTWHpbUTfqfQAfm0WwG_10205271281047476.jpg,8226

Since my 4 children have recently gotten out of the preschool years, I have taken more time to catalog and organize my recipe collection. I appreciate all the wonderful recipes I have found here and the effort to input them. My family and I appreciate the good food that has become part of what we regularly enjoy eating. Besides cooking and taking care of my children and family, I love reading and playing piano. I also love classical guitar, and as my kids grow older, I would like to devote time to learning to play better (I'm really just a beginner). The arts bring me a lot of joy (music, visual, performance, literary, culinary). I also find joy in the beauty that is in the world and nature... I'm fortunate to live close to the beautiful Wasatch Mountains and not too far from many beautiful national parks in the state of Utah. I feel we have a responsibility to reach out and help others, and as a follower of Jesus Christ, I hope to make a positive contribution to my family, local church congregation, neighborhood, community, and to worthy causes that inspire me. I find that many charitable organizations are not giving enough to help the less fortunate or to whatever is their cuase, but I really like The Smile Train, and the programs of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints which are mostly run by volunteers (main humanitarian missions... eyeglasses, clean water , Neonatal Resuscitation, Emergency Response, Wheelchairs, Food Production, and Immunizations). I am very thankful for a good and abundant life and am sad for the great suffering that many people endure in life. I believe in an Eternal equalization or fixing of injustice, and I look forward to the day God will surely make everything right.",Contributor,4.6,"Salt Lake City, Utah",2009-04-01,1,2,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pasta.png,67

I love ethnic foods of all sorts and love to try all sorts of new tastes.We try to eat light and healthy most of the time but once in awhile... I began my love for cooking and eating good quality foods as a young child. My mom loved to cook for us and since she came down with juvenile diabetes when I was 4 years old,she taught us all about nutrition. Both of my older brothers have a passion for great food as well and are terrific cooks.She never taught me to cook though! She said since she had to learn it on her own so should I.I started with baking and mastered it pretty well. I also made my first Thanksgiving dinner at 17. I became obsessed with nutrition and healthy eating as a teenager and managed to teach my mom a thing or two. As her tastes and cooking techniques changed so did mine. We spent a lot of our time together talking about food, trading recipes or eating.My parents always encouraged us to broaden our horizons and try any new food that came our way.I now have her recipe collection and plan on posting them here soon. I always told her they should be published! My other passions are gardening/landscaping, home improvement, decorating, antique collecting,fitness, my pets and my family to name just a few.

I Okboberfest, Mexican and Thai etc. I generally do the research and each person can either choose from the recipes I have found or bring one of their own. I like to give the option since a lot of people don't necessarily have any recipes for that particular theme party. Anyway its fun.

I still like to do that sometimes, but for the day-to-day chore of cooking (and sometimes it is a chore) I like the option of fast and simple. I enjoy trying new recipes and sharing favorites of mine. I have found that sometimes the most unlikely sounding ones turn out to be the best!

(It's really not as exciting as it sounds.) Actually, I enjoy my job. There are worse things I could be doing to finance my cooking / baking habits. I never really knew how to cook growing up. Some of you in the Breads and Baking forum have heard my disastrous story about making Nestle Toll House cookies... When I went to college and moved out of the dorms, I started to become interested in actually learning how to cook. I had a lactose intolerant boyfriend, and a limited budget, so it made sense to stop eating take-out pizza and Taco Bell every day. I have to credit The Dairy Free Cookbook by Jane Zukin as my first real guide. (I still cook out of it , even though the boyfriend is long gone!) With that as a start, I set about systematically teaching myself how to cook. Five years later, I'm getting a reputation from friends and family as being a good cook. I love baking bread from scratch (I could really become a sourdough freak - thanks Donna!) - I can't seem to make enough cinnamon raisin swirl to keep my mom and grandmother happy. I'm enjoying getting back to eating seasonally, eschewing over - processed prepared food in favor of simpler, healthier, better tasting, cheaper meals I make myself. When I set out to learn, I never imagined I'd be making stock, roasting whole chickens, baking bread, or shopping at our local farmer's market. Now I can't imagine going back to the way I used to eat. I hope someday to learn enough about bread baking to open a local bakery/cafe, somewhere in Westport or Downtown Kansas City. I love my city, and the kind of place I have in mind will be a place that gives back to the community. I want to leave this city a better place for my having been here. Here's my standard metric for how I review recipes here, because I want my reviews to be helpful and consistent: ***** Fantastic as is. Wouldn't change a thing and will make it often. 0**** Fantastic tweaked a little to suit my tastes. Will make it often. 00*** Had to tweak it alot to get something I would make again. 000** Not very good. May try tweaking it again at some point. 0000* Not good.

I love cooking for crowds and parties, I love rock n roll, beer and wine, and getting people to try things they would never think of eating and 99% of the time, my way they love.",Contributor,3.1,United States,2003-09-01,0,0,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/drink.png,10429

I am trying to convince him cooking school is the way to go, but he wants to be like Dad...what can you do?   We own our own Reposession Company in Fort Lauderdale that keeps us very busy.  When we aren't working we are doing alot of work on our home and yard. We tend to have a lot of impromtu get togethers, mostly BBQ's by the pool and such, not too stuffy at our house. Your a guest the first time you come over, after that your part of the family and mi casa is su casa. I of course love to cook, collect recipes and cookbooks and anything that has to do with food. I play Bunco once a month with 11 other women that are just awesome, which we always have lots of yummy munchies at. So I am hoping I get some new recipes here to try out on them.

This picture was taken the 2nd night when we all ride through town and the residents come out to see us. Very cool! Now onto the real reason we're here... I'm a food lovin' gal who's looking for new great recipes that are fast, cheap and tasty. Oh and non-dairy is important as my husband's lactose intolerant. I have lived on Vancouver Island for my entire life.. have see scenery that many people will never ever experience thanks to growing up on the family boat pretty much year round, because of this I know that actual silence can be the most amazing thing and while so quite, so noisy at the same time... I love animals and currently I run a vet hospital which is enjoyable and stressing at the same time. (why can't everyone want to take care of their pets???) I am horribly in love with my DH and we're working on 5 years of marriage, not much for some, but most of our friends figured we'd have killed ourselves by now ( we're pretty good about not keeping things bottled up) We had the most fun wedding you could have imagined.. we even chose the songs WE wanted.... He walked down to the ""James Bond"" theme song and I walked down to ""Imperial March"". I have a 90 gallon fish tank and an adopted Mini Australian Sheperd called ""Ozzy"". Born March 28/06 he's well into his teens years mentality and has a couple of trust issues but wants to be a good dog. He's SUPER cute and VERY smart. I try to be healthy, I work out on occassion, but mostly try to eat healthy, which I find easy because junk food makes me feel crapy. I love music, pretty much everything, my favorite band is the Red Hot Chili Peppers. I love rock and oldies. I spend my childhood playing a huge list of instruments, from drums, to saxaphone and piano. I love to read but get VERY little time to do it. My favorite author is Clive Clusser, who writes the Dirk Pitt Novels, although I'm not a fan of his new novels, because its not him writing them. I am a ""Twilight"" addict. I also love ""Life of Pi"" and ""Self"" by Yann Martel. I read Mordaci Richler when I was 10 for fun, when most adults couldn't read it. I would like to someday read Moby Dick and War and Peace, just to say I've done it. Someday I might write a book myself. Who knows. My days are spent at work, my nights and weekends are spent taking care of the house and my DH. People ask when we're going to have kids and I say "" why? I married my child and he brings home an income"". My DH is a child at heart and while currently not involved in mixed martial arts fighting, which he loves, has taken a break to discover the wide world of paintball and dirtbiking. Either way, it keeps him out of my hair. When we first started dating I quickly found that its just easier to support him and let him do what he wants (almost) and it leaves me to do my thing.

I work for a major computer storage company keeping one of our larger customers happy from a support (after the sale) perspective.

I don't get to cook as much as I'd like to, but when I can, I love to try new recipes! I'm always looking for great make ahead or CrockPot recipes that accomodate my crazy work. I love the feature on 'Zaar where you can find recipes by searching for an ingredient. I've come up with more dinner ideas that way! I'm blessed with a husband who is always willing to try new things, but who is also happy to eat PBJ every night. That makes it easy for me, but I'm more fickle than that!

I'VE ARRANGED THEM SO THAT COOKBOOK SERIES OR SIMPLY COOKBOOKS ON RELATED TOPICS APPEAR TOGETHER, WHICH SHOULD MAKE IT EASIER TO FIND THE ONES THAT INTEREST YOU.] In 2004, I moved home to New England after many years living in the South. Often I go walking in the morning with my sister, who lives near me on the Maine coast--we truly live in a beautiful place. I share a love of ACC basketball with my brother in upstate New York. Nowadays, I rely heavily on Kitty Rosati's Heal Your Heart book (lots of low-sodium recipes) and Donald Gazzaniga's No-Salt, Lowest-Sodium Cookbook. Other cookbooks I frequently use are Weil & Daley's The Healthy Kitchen and Cooking Light's Five-Star Recipes cookbook. From January 2005 to September 2008, I hosted the recipe tagging game ONE-TWO-THREE HIT WONDERS, taking four months off in late 2007, during which the tireless, compassionate and totally wonderful Game Forum Hosts ~Nimz~, justcallmetoni, Lauralie41 and Andi of Longmeadow Farm with incredible kindness of took over my workload. I loved hosting the game and the players there were and are the best, but competing obligations required me to give it up and it's now ably presided over by HokiesLady. In 2008 my dear sister finally joined Recipezaar. Her chef name is Sagadahoc (the county in Maine she lives in). My popular Recipe #89132 is actually her recipe--check it out sometime, it's great! She eventually realized how useful having several cookbooks can be, so I gave her a premium membership as her birthday present in March 2008. Some of my favorite sources of recipes are the public cookbooks of other Zaar chefs. I have over 100 bookmarked to refer to occasionally, but some of my favorites are from the following: In January-February 2007, the Chefs of 1-2-3 Hit Wonders hosted a Cook-a-Thon for veteran Zaar member Sharon123 while she was undergoing chemotherapy at Duke University. The entire group of recipes tagged, cooked and reviewed for the Cook-a-Thon are contained in: Sharon123's Cook-a-Thon Cookbook ~Rita~: Thanks to her stunning photographs, she has one of the most beautiful cookbook lists at Zaar. Her cookbooks focus on a variety of inspired topics, many of them health-related, and the introductions often provide an encyclopedic disquisition on the topic at hand. Some stand-outs: Edible Flowers Honey Honey You`ve got me wanting you! Recipes I named after zaar chefs Menopause If you've been around Zaar any length of time, you probably know that Bergy writes wonderfully detailed and helpful recipe reviews and has also contributed a wealth of wonderful recipes of her own. Judging from comments in the forums, her burger cookbook is the most popular and referenced cookbook at Zaar, and her appetizers cookbook is a treasury of finger foods as well as a major hunting ground for Dim Sum: Saturday Night Burgers Appetizers/Finger Foods PaulaG's own recipes are a well I go back to again and again--I've made tons of her dishes, with great results. Cookbooks of hers I find especially handy include: Chicken Recipes Then There Were 2 As I mentioned above, while I love the cuisines of all regions of the world, my favorite is Greek, and the following from Cookiegirlandi is chockful of great Greek recipes: It's All Greek (Another great way to find Greek recipes is to go cirectly to evelyn/athens' recipe list and then sift for Cuisine-->European__>Southern-->Greek. She currently has 142.) UPDATE: evelyn/athens, host of the Greek Cooking Forum and Greek food expert extraordinaire has a cookbook of her own Greek fecipes that could be the only reference you'll ever need for Greek cuisine: Greek Cookery I'm not a vegetarian, but I do eat meatless meals a fair amount of the time. I've observed that Sharon123 is a great one for cooking fare that's healthy and tastes great, which is why I trust and turn to her: Yummy Vegetarian Dishes If I want to cook something to eat with my friends, the go-to person is Miss Annie: Recipes for Entertaining Pot Luck /Picnic Recipes Dancer^ is single-handedly responsible for tons of great salad dressing and seasoning mixes posted at Zaar. See the evidence in her cookbooks: Dressings & Vinaigrettes Spice and Herb Mixes If I'm hanging out in heaven a hundred years from now, I'm hoping to find they've had the good sense to make NcMysteryShopper and Bev the twin bartenders there, so after I go to my final reward I can continue to imbibe offerings from Cheryl's Book #99544, Book #148198, Book #90314, Book #73634, Book #75595, Book #74074 and Book #70836 cookbooks and Bev's Book #86058 and Book #124180 cookbooks. These ladies know how to set 'em up and I know how to chug 'em! Julesong was one of the first to take advantage of the multiple-cookbook option of premium membership in a big way. For awhile she held the record for most cookbooks at Zaar. Some of those I've particularly liked include: Junior League Cookbook Recipes Second Chance - a generous list of Zaar recipes that received a low-to-mediocre rating but may deserve a second look Newspaper Recipes - some of my own favorites have come from newspapers, including the original version of my most popular recipe Recipe #88939. Old Bay Recipes Penzey's Recipes Gooseberry Patch Recipes They Call Me the Soup Fairy... ;) Julie's Soups - Julie has some great soups in her repertoire! Famous Chefs - Julia Child, my hero! (My favorite from among her exhaustive collection of Famous Chefs cookbooks) I'll admit I've never actually made anything in them, but Amber of AZ and Mirj have two of the most fun cookbooks to peruse: The Bizarre of Recipezaar - Amber Funny Recipes - Mirj I'm always looking to lose weight, so really appreciate all the fine folks who've come up with cookbooks for dieters. Other than keeping my sodium intake low most of the time for my blood pressure, I don't follow any particular one of the popular diets, but rather am just an old-fashioned calorie counter.

When I see in my Zaar InBox one of her thoughtful notes just sent out of the blue to offer an encouraging word, it makes my day. She has a goodly collection of cookbooks, but her true achievement is the 3,000+ recipes she's posted--how does she manage to be so prolific yet keep the quality of her offerings so high?

I own more gardening and craft books than cook books, that's what drew me to recipezaar. My passions are cooking, gardening, scrapbooking, sewing and spending time with my family. My biggest problem right now is finding time to spend on this wonderful site. Last summer I did start back up canning and I even purchased a pressure canner so now I'm canning a little more than just jams and jellies.

I live in Black Forest, just north of Colorado Springs with my husband, Jim (an engineer) and Ripley (Bichon Frisee) and Bogey (miniature Aussie). We love it here--we see lots of deer, sometimes a bear, cayotes, foxes, racoons, and squirrels. We have a huge pond on the property. The mallards are here now and they have babies every year. I was a buyer of electronics for the aircraft and medical industries for 26 years. I guess I'm semi-retired; I work occasionally when something comes up. My last job was in a bank. When that branch closed I quit and have been looking for something to do since then, either a job or volunteer work. Our daughter is grown and we have two grandkids, one girl and one boy. They call me Grammy Donna. I love to paint (watercolors), read, cook, scuba dive, garden and travel. Our favorite scuba destination is Cozumel and we go whenever we can. I would love to dive the Great Barrier Reef someday. My husband loves my cooking and always asks that I cook enough for leftovers for lunch. Once at a work gathering one of his co-workers came up to me and said ""Jim's lunches are the envy of everybody here"". My mother would never let me cook, so the minute I moved away cooking became my passion. As a teen I copied recipes out of her magazines, saving them for when I was on my own. I love planning menus for the week and try to make our meals interesting and varied. Living at an altitude of 7,500 feet makes baking difficult, even using the high altitude adjustments. Also, I love to garden, but the growing season is only three months if we're lucky. I have seen it snow after Memorial Day here. My pet peeve is people who think they are better than eveyone else and people that tailgate me when driving. Also, people who start out their reviews ""I'm not going to rate this because bla bla bla. They don't seem to know that by not rating they are giving the recipe 0 stars, thus lowering the total rating of the recipe. Also reviews that state that they made a recipe but added this and changed that and say that ""this way it's better"" Why don't they just post their own recipe? I do not give bad ratings. This is supposed to be a friendly community and there is no reason to hurt someone's feelings. This is not Iron Chef or Hell's Kitchen. I have been cooking long enough to tell by reading a recipe whether we'll like it or not.",Contributor,4.8,United States,2004-01-01,0,0,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/burger.png,2310

88461,165623,https://www.food.com/user/165623,Hill Family,"This is a family cookbook by the Hill Family. It all started with Charlie and Mary Hill. They had 7 children; Bruce, Francis, Howard, Charlie, Mignon, Joe and Sarah. Food and cooking was a big part of Charlie and Mary's lives and has been a big part of their childrens lives as well. Francis's Poem The Hill Clan even talks about it. The Hill Clan When we were growing up, there was plenty, Seven kids to feed, that was too many. Dad, I remember you always worked hard. And when it came to gambling, you were a card. Mom, you were always in the kitchen, Cooking, baking and making decisions. What to do with one pound of hamburger, to feed seven, And you always did, Oh thank heaven!!! Bruce and I were always elected to do the dishes, And we always did, with Dad's best wishes. Howard and Charlie were on the run, The rest of us prayed they would never get a gun. Mom, Mignon always hung in there by your knee, You couldn't even take time to pee. Then, there was Joe, we couldn't figure where he came from, The baker, the milkman, or some bum. Sarah Ann, we thought she was the best, She turned out to be the biggest mess. This little ditty was just for fun, For the rest of my life I will be on the run. This picture was taken at Mary and Charlie's 50th Wedding Anniversary in 1988. Mary wrote this poem for that occasion and read it before the cake was cut. Fifty Year Anniversary Fifty years of marriage is something to behold, Especially if all your friends are one hundred percent all gold. And to come from a very large family that came many miles, To wish us both the best of luck, with a kiss, a hug, and a smile. We wonder how we can be so lucky to have all our children, grandchildren and great grandchildren here, We hold them all so very dear. It has been a wonderful anniversary, And I must confess that we love you all and thank you all, And close with just a heartfelt God Bless. These recipes are from not only from Mary and Charlie, but their 7 children, their spouses, their children and spouses. Thrown in are also recipes from Mary's sister and niece. The Hill clan produced lots of good cooks and even more good eaters. Mary also wrote this poem about her 50 years of marriage and boy was she right about more grandchildren and greatgrandchildren to come. 50 Years It has been 50 years since I was caught. Charlie chased me down and we tied the knot. With a family of seven, it took alot of living. But more then that, lots of forgiving. We had four boys and three girls, And I'm happy to say, they are still with us up to this day. Nineteen grandchildren and five great, I am sure there will be more, after this date. We done our part for posterity, I think that's the way it's supposed to be. There will always be room for more. We have hung a welcome sign on our door.

I am from Ohio originally, but lived in New Mexico for 3 years, before moving back several years ago. Like everyone here, I LOVE to cook. I used to feel that I didn't have time, but now I am learning to make time. It's so important to me to sit down to dinner together as a family. My favorite part of the day. Since I started working from home four years ago, it really has assisted in my flexibility to prepare a healthy, delicious dinner every night. I feel like I still have alot I can learn, especially when it comes to baking. I was married in September, 2006 to my best friend, Estevan. My husband and I share a love of cooking together. I really enjoy planning out the week and deciding what we will try next, and it takes the panic out of what's for dinner? I also try to do OAMC (once a month cooking) method when I can. I love the food netork, and I really love Rachel Ray and her cookbooks. I have recently been cooking alot out of her big orange book. It is my newest favorite. I am abit of a cookbook collector, and recently purchased a larger bookcase to store all of them in my kitchen. However, I tend to rely on recipezaar first now when I am looking for something in particular. I love this site and it's community of users! In my free time, I enjoy scrapbooking and would love to devote more time to it as a hobby. It is a great creative release for me. Estevan and I love to travel as much as we can as well. We were blessed with our first son 2 years ago (Grayson), and are enjoying being parents. We also have 3 furry kids, Bailey, (german shepard/ blue heeler) and 2 bichons - Bella and Jack.

I work for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (R.C.M.P.), which is a extremely interesting job. My family consists of my husband Brian and we had a blue eyed Siberian Husky named Yukon who loved her 2 to 3 walks a day. Yukon passed away on July 24/07 at the age of 14 years & 7 months. We have a beautiful male Tuxedo cat named Kuffs, whom we rescued in December, 2006. He around 6 weeks old & was dumped off at my husband's business in -30 Celcius weather & was half froze when Brian found him. Kuffs brought back life into Yukon for the nine months that he was with her. Those two certainly loved to cuddle & chase one another. After Yukon's passing, Kuffs quit eating, looked for Yukon & cried constantly. We had full intentions of getting him a playmate but it happened sooner than later. That same week we went to the Humane Society (SPCA)& adopted a gorgeous little female pure grey kitten & named her Jesse. She is just precious & became Kuffs baby sister. I love to try different recipes and Recipezaar has provided me with some of the most tasty and wonderful recipes yet. Things I enjoy doing are walking,reading a good novel, sewing, crafts, traveling, camping and being with good friends and family.",Contributor,4.3,Canada,2004-08-01,0,2,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pasta.png,5330

I have since moved on but there's a slippery place I don't want to revisit soon! I’ve got three great kids, the youngest of whom is completing his PhD in food science. What I imagined might be a really neat advanced culinary experience for him turns out to be a major tour into chemistry (which is about as accessible to me as nuclear physics). But I have to admit, it is interesting to hear how a no-fat dairy cream can be concocted. Better living through chemistry, right? Update! My bouncing baby boy is now a PhD and even better, he is a new father for the second time! He and his lovely bride have just been blessed with another beautiful daughter, my 4th grand child. Now to find that job... I’m probably a million dollar’s worth of 2 cent information but that doesn’t help when it comes to feeding myself. I figured out quickly that if I am to to survive, I better learn how to cook! I never met a cookbook I didn’t like and I’m open to most any cuisine but without a sense of organization, the information overload was sinking me.

Almost all of my recipes come from Zaar now, although I will never part with my Mennonite Community Cookbook. (It remains the most informative cookbook I own, and is the style of food I grew up on.) I believe in eliminating unnatural additives in our diet by avoiding prepared foods whenever possible. I have made my own cream of chicken soup, barbecue sauce, mayonnaise, and more! If I had more time, maybe lived in colonial days, I would do more of that... :) But I also work full time in a church-based preschool teaching 3 year-olds. During the school year, lesson planning keeps me very busy. My mother-in-law recently moved in with us, so we're trying to work out the sharing of kitchen duties.

Since moving to Europe I've been lucky enough to have had the opportunity to go a couple of times per year to Paris, as well as having visited London, Rome, Florence, Naples, Amsterdam, and of course Brussels and Antwerp. I've seen at least parts of most regions of France, as well as parts of Germany, Austria, a great deal of Switzerland, Slovenia, Croatia, Luxembourg, and Monaco. I'm absolutely in love with the Bay of Naples and Sorrento coast areas of Italy, which my husband and I recently re-visited on a trip that included Rome, Puglia, Umbria and Marche. I'm still looking forward to Ireland, Spain, Portugal, the Czech Republic . . . the list is too long ! One of the bonuses of travel is getting to taste the local cuisine, and afterward trying to figure out how to duplicate it at home. I think cooking is one of the nicest things a person can do for someone they love (including themself!) I had to submit a picture with me and my cat, Sophie, as she insists on sitting in my lap when I'm sitting at the computer.

The summer was absolutely beautiful! It never got to 100 degrees! Coming from Phoenix, we both enjoy being away from the heat and the city. Our first snow this year was absolutely gorgeous! My recipe ratings pretty much follow the star system. I will usually make a recipe as is the first time. I say usually but I do still change things sometimes. I try to be fair if I have made changes. I will rate 5 stars if we LOVE it and it will be a regular dish around our house. 4 stars if we really liked it and 3 stars if it was just OK but we wouldn't make it again. I realize everyone's tastes are different so I do try to be gentle. Cooking can be a very personal thing to someone. Another creative outlet for me is beading. I love to make beaded jewelry.

89820,87023,https://www.food.com/user/87023,Latchy,"Our dear friend Latchy passed away from acute myeloid leukemia in August 2006, after being diagnosed with the disease in October 2005. She was a dear friend to many Recipezaar members throughout the world and she will be greatly missed. Latchy was a great chef; and her speciality was Asian food. She loved wine and cheese, but wasn’t fussed on desserts. She had a great sense of humour and was the life of any party. Latchy was her childhood nickname, and those of us who knew her real name still called her ‘Latch’. We loved her. With the permission of Latchy’s daughter, here is the eulogy read at her funeral (edited slightly to maintain the family’s privacy). Recipezaar and her Recipezaar chat group, the ‘Tipsy Tarts’ were represented at the funeral by Latchy’s close Zaar friends, Mummamills, Chrissyo and Liara: “Latchy, was born in Melbourne in 1939. In her younger years she led a very energetic life and was very involved in swimming and dancing. She had the opportunity to compete in the 1956 Olympics but couldn’t be fussed to do the training and preferred to enjoy herself instead. Latchy met her late husband, Bruce, in Melbourne. Bruce being with the army, they started their life of travel together and extended their family. Their first child was born in Perth, their second in New Guinea and their third child, in Melbourne. They also lived in Newcastle, Sydney, and Singapore before settling in Brisbane. It was in Singapore that her love of cooking, sewing and craft began. Latchy broke military protocol for dining-in nights. Women were finally allowed to attend. One day, Bruce was watching a TV program about sailing around the world. On the program when the wife was told of this plan she said “No Way”, but Latchy said, “When are you going to start?” So, Bruce retired from the army to begin building a 54 foot steel ketch in the back yard, learning as he went. Latchy worked for many years until they finally set off around the world in 1987. They got as far as Malaysia and loved it so much they didn’t go any further. They loved the lifestyle, the people and the food and only came back when Bruce fell ill. After Bruce passed away, Latchy developed her talents, such as painting, and became involved with her family and grandchildren. About 7 years ago, she decided to make her life in Hervey Bay, a beach-side retirement town in Queensland, Australia. She loved the lifestyle, the people and became very involved in the community life. Latchy started volunteering with tax help, then the multicultural respite where she put her cooking skills to use and then with Legacy (an organization which supports the widows of servicemen and ex-servicemen). Latchy opened up a new world by learning about computers and the internet and she met her great friends, the Tipsy Tarts through the website Recipezaar. Latchy was a strong, independent, funny, straight forward and loving mother, grandmother and friend, and we will miss her greatly.”",Contributor,4.6,"Torquay, Queensland - Australia",2003-05-01,0,13,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/taco.png,2852

Very seldom did she use a recipe or use measuring cups unless it was for baking. She used the pinch of this, a dash of that method.Wish I would have paid more attention back in the day but luckily my sister remembers most of the things I don't. I, on the other hand, most always have to have a recipe in front of me no matter how many times I've made something. I have a ton of cookbooks that are now a little dusty since I came across Recipezaar a few years ago. There is one thing here with the reviewers that bothers me a bit. They will completely change ingredients or cooking method and then leave a negative review. I usually try to follow a recipe as closely as possible although sometimes I will change it due to ingredients on hand or to personal preference but if I make the slightest alteration and don't like it, I just wont leave a review. I love my family, friends and all animals. Especially my 10 year old yorkie Munchkin, my 5 year old silky terrier Rowdy and our outside pets, the geckos. I have the best husband a girl could ever hope for and I'm blessed in so many ways.

89899,1329782,https://www.food.com/user/1329782,SarasotaCook,"Growing up in Michigan, I spent my summers at my cottage in the Northern part up by Traverscity. On a lake, big garden which had all the vegetables you could imagine. My mom taught school, so summers were our vacation time. Gramps and I fished all the time so fresh fish was always on the menu, perch, blue gill, walleye and small and large mouth bass. At age 5 I learned how to clean my own fish and by 10 I was making dinner, canning vegetables and fruits, making pies and fresh breads. Apples fresh picked every fall, strawberries in June and July, Cherries at the Cherry Festival in Traverscity. So fresh foods always were a big part. Mom worked as a teacher during the year so dinner was more traditional with pot roasts, meatloaf, etc, but it seemed we always had fresh fruits and vegetables as part of the meal. Mom also didn't use as many spices as I do, but times were different back then. So ... My motto is ... There is NO Right and NO Wrong with cooking. So many people thing they have to follow a recipe. But NO ... a recipe is a method and directions to help and teach someone. Cooking is about personal tastes and flavors. I love garlic ... and another person may not. I like heat ... but you may not. Recipes are building blocks, NOT text ground in stone. Use them to make and build on. Even my recipes I don't follow most times --They are a base. That is what cooking is to me. A base of layer upon layer of flavors. I still dislike using canned soups or packaged gravies/seasoning ... but I admit, I do use them. I have a few recipes that use them. But I try to strive to teach people to use fresh ingredients, they are first ... so much healthier for you ... and second, in the end less expensive. But we all have our moments including me. So, lets see ... In the past, I have worked as a hostess, bartender, waitress, then a short order cook, salad girl in the kitchen, sort of assistant chef, head chef, co owner of a restaurant ... now a consultant to a catering company/restaurant, I cater myself and I'm a personal chef for a elderly lady. I work doing data entry during the day, and now and then try to have fun which is not very often due to my job(s). I have a 21 year old who at times is going on 12, aren't they all. Was married and now single and just trying to enjoy life one day at a time. I'm writing a cookbook ... name is still in the works but it is dedicated to those people who never learned, to cook. Single Moms, Dads, or Just Busy Parents. Those individuals that think you can't make a great dinner for not a lot of money. You can entertain on a budget and I want people to know that gourmet tasting food doesn't have to be from a can of soup or a box, and healthy food doesn't come from a drive through. There are some really good meals that people can make which are healthy and will save money but taste amazing. So I guess that is my current goal. We all take short cuts and I have no problem with that - I do it too. I volunteer and make food for the homeless every couple of months, donating my time and money. I usually make soup for them and many times get donations from a local grocery stores, Sams Club, Walmart etc, with broth, and vegetables. It makes my cost very little and well worth every minute I spend.

We hate seeing him have a seizure it breaks our heart! I started collecting cookbooks, but by far this website is MUCH better than any cookbook.

I made foods for me and my husband as newlyweds and I know he choked some of it down with a smile. He still jokes to this day about when I made spaghetti and I didn't heat the sauce up. I just poured it over the hot noodles thinking they would warm the sauce - not so! Cold dinner - ick! Well I've gotten a lot better and my ultimate goal is to be the best cook in my family. I like to try new things and especially try to find recipes for foods that most people do not like. My rating system 1 star = will not eat again, will not make again. 2 stars = will not make again, but would eat it, if someone else made it for me 3 stars = Good, not the best I've ever had, but good flavor. 4 stars = Very good. I will make it again on occassion and would even recommend to others. 5 stars = Excellent. The best of it's kind that I've tasted, easy to make, others liked it too.

Many list whiny people as their peeve. Hey...I live in NYC where almost EVERYONE whines and complains, so I don't notice anymore. What burns my biscuits is seeing recipes that call for some really funky ingredients like Kraft (cough cough) Parmesan cheese in the green can and chicken from a can. I had never even heard of chicken in CAN(???) until last year. Get the best quality ingredients you purse will allow. That includes spices. Those jars of spices that sell for 99 cents are no bargain if you can afford something better. Do yourself a favor and if possible, go and explore any ethnic food markets in your area.

A few other chefs I read/enjoy watching on t.v. are: Giada At Home, Ina Garten's The Barefoot Contessa, Nigella Lawson's Nigella Bites, and Patti's Mexican Kitchen, and many more. On my bucket list is dining at Thomas Keller's establishment The French Laundry in Napa Valley, California... as well as Alice Waters' Chez Panisse in Berkeley, and the James Beard award winning Tartine Bakery and Cafe in San Francisco.

I am trained as a Professional Cook, even have a cooking certificate, lol. The best education I ever got was going to cooking school. I spent 3 years cooking in a gas station restaurant and all was well working there, but my heart still wanted to cook for kids. October 2008 I finally got the job I wanted. I been cooking for the kids for just over a year now and I love every day of it. The kids are great, some frustration, but it is all good, they are so smiley everyday, how could you not like work when you have a bunch of smiling faces looking at you. Another good thing about my job is I get the summers off. I had a pretty good summer, I got to tend to my garden and get a bunch of stuff into the freezers, I was given a second freezer this summer. I have been planning on eating mainly out of the freezers so we can save some extra cash for Christmas. I have plans on finding some nutrition courses that I can do online, just for dabbling in, it would sure help with cooking for the kids. I live with my hubby and 3 kids (11,6,5), and one cat, who is part in-door, out-door.

Comfort food during the long cold winters and clambakes items for the summer. I work as a function manager and am getting ideas from the chef who works here. The best advice she has given me has been, a recipe is just a guideline. You can add and subtract whatever you want. I have been able to find an awesome red sauce recipe from scratch sent to me via recipezaar member and fellow Red Soxs Fan! I learned how to cook out of pure self defense. As much as I love my mother, she can't cook. Unfortuantely my younger sister has obtained my mother's cooking skills. My father's mother who lived with us growing up couldn't cook either. She could bake. THAT she was good at. My mother would microwave EVERYTHING, including roast beef. Even to this day, Roast beef in the microwave for 15 minutes and its done. Its not exactly tasty. My grandmother would boil everything to the point of non-chewable. I refuse to use the microwave unless it is reheating something. The foodnetwork channel is my all time favorite channel. I love Paula Deen and Tyler Florence, although I wish his new show would stop making me dizzy with the camera shots moving so quickly around the set.

So I thought I'd have a look around, I ended up being here until 3 or 4 am. Yes I was hooked at first site and had to sign up the next day. I love being able to post my family recipes and know they're safe, and being able to retreive them no matter where I am. I once had to call the local library in B.C. to ask the librarian to look up a recipe. I lost it on the move back to the maritimes. I can only imagine what the lady was thinking, having someone call her to look up a recipe all the way from Nova Scotia. I couldn't find it any where, this was my last resort. This was the first recipe I posted, I vowed I wasn't going to missplase it again. recipe#223803 I must mention that I live in a zoo. We have 1 dog, 2 cats, 1 snake and a whole lot of fish. In a small 3 bedroom bungalow. I also have 2 children, boy 12, girl 10 and a husband. My children and I are registered organ donors. I feel if I would take an organ for my children I better be willing to give one. I'll take this time to mention, it's not enough to tell your family you wish to donate you must also register. I've been married for almost 13 years now. (I can't believe it been that long) I've been blessed with a wonderfull partner, I couldn't dream of being with anyone else. We get each other and when we don't, we fill each other in. I love to bake, especially cookies. I also love to knit and I sew a little. But I would sew more if I had a sewing room. My passion is knitting if I could make good money from it I'd do it for a living. I do knit for a yarn shop in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, I really love doing this because I get to knit with yarns I wouldn't be able to afford. Mind you this has made me quite the yarn snob. If you have any questions about knitting feel free to z-mail them to me I love keeping the art of knitting alive. I love cookie cook books I'm a sucker for them especially ones with lots of pictures. My rating system is below. I like to see how others rate recipies. I find it helpful when recieving one. I know I might give stars a little too freely, But I usually know what we like by the ingredient list. I am very picky when I choose to try a recipe. I hate to waste food, it's not cheap. I might also pick a recipe because of lots of positive reviews. To me alot of reviews mean it appeals to alot of different tastes. I do not take much stock in bad reviews because after all it is a matter of tastes. I do like to review recipes I've tried. Mostly because I love recieving reviews and I feel others must like it too. Also it is a good way for me to find the recipes if tried. I just look up my own personal reviews to find the recipes my family likes. It's easier than sorting through my main cookbook, which is now up to 450 recipes.",Contributor,4.7,,2007-04-01,21,2,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/sushi.png,8581

I am a photo editor at a famous magazine publisher whose mission it is to ""increase and diffuse Geographic knowledge."" No, I don't get to travel. It's just a job, like most others out there. 9-5 and draining! Not nearly as glamorous as many imagine. My true passions are marine biology, nature in general, and cooking. I have been cooking since I was old enough to help out Mom in the kitchen. I have always been adventurous in eating, and am willing to try anything at least once. I am always searching out new flavors, ingredients, and techniques. I love shopping in all the ethnic grocery stores that abound in this area... Vietnamese, Pakistani, Indian, Afghan, Hispanic of all sorts, Korean, Russian, German. I would love to be able to open a small gourmet food store or deli in a beach-side town. Oh my, my paradise and dream. Cook in the morning, then enjoy the beach in the evening. It would be hard to name a favorite cookbook. I owned over 500 at one time, and have since whittled down my collection. A cookbook was always my favorite souvenir from any travels I took. Hmmmm, I guess I would have to say my favorites are the Marlboro cookbooks. Yes, put out by the Marlboro cigarette company. No, I do not smoke, but these cookbooks are beautiful to look at, and the recipes are to die for. They consist of good old American foods, grilling, and just good times for all. These 3 books are my food porn! ;-) I enjoy Nigella Lawson's cookbooks, too. She has style, flair, and a wonderful sense of humor. If I had to pick a famous foodie to dine with it would be her.

He came into our lives when he ran out in front of my car late one night as I was driving home. A just under 4 pound ball of kitten fluff, complete with an ostrich boa tail that stayed straight up as he assessed his new domain. He became a 19 pound longhaired beast who guarded our house (he followed any new guests or servicepeople the entire time they are on the property) & even killed copperheads (among other things with his hunting buddy, Fergus the short-tailed)! Friends never saw his formidible side as he smiled at them & uttered the most incongruent kitten-like mews as he threaded legs! He liked to ride in the car & came to the beach. There are Buster-approved recipes in my offerings - however, HE decided which he wanted to consider - Buster demonstrated he liked pumpkin anything - ALOT -LOL!!!

The Middle Eastern/African likes I have are remnants of my parents who lived for many years in North Africa & Mediterranean before I was thought of. Makes for wide open cooking! Since moving back east we try to go annually in the deep winter to Montreal (Old Montreal auberges & La Reine) & Quebec City (Winter Carnival & Chateau Frontenac)- for unctuous foie gras & real cheeses, French & Canadian meals prepared & served exquisitely, fantastic music & wonderful people - with the cold helping burn off some of the calories! I love putting in our aluminum jonboat & heading across the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW) to the barrier islands for foraging & exploring! Bodysurfing is a lifelong sport for me - one that a person's body never seems to forget how to do, once the knack is learned (thank goodness!)

90818,23302,https://www.food.com/user/23302,Millereg,"Gavin ""Miller"" Duncan passed away November 12, 2004 in Laurel, MD from complications of a ""broken"" heart. The outpouring of support from the Recipezaar community while his health was declining was a huge comfort to him and even ""perked him up"" a bit in his final month. Miller was a huge asset to Recipezaar, not only due to his incredible collection of recipes, but his participation in the forums. Miller was known for his wonderful low-sodium recipes, his warmth, and last, but not least, his wicked, dry sense of humor. Liza at Recipezaar ********************************************************* No, the picture to the left is not me. It is, in fact, a picture of famous TV Chef Jamie Oliver (a/k/a Thpit Boy)’s grandfather, the late Sir Topaz McWhacker. Note the strong family resemblance, most noticeable in the nose, eyebrows, and general lack of cleanliness Legend has it that Topaz taught Thpit everything that he knows about whacking and about only washing and combing his hair twice a year. . Instead of the trivia that many Recipezaar members have displayed on their “About Me” pages, I thought it might be a tad more helpful if I were to provide some beneficial information that you can put to good practical use either in your own kitchen or when you are watching the antics of some celebrated TV chefs. So, for your enlightenment..... . . Chairman Kaga: When he says “Ion Shff”, he really means “Iron Chef” or, perhaps, “I need a Kleenex” . Chef Paula Deen: When she says “awl”, she really means “oil”. When she says “y’all”, she really means “everyone except m’all”. When she says “bring the water to a bawl”, I have no clue what she means - I thought you could only make a baby “bawl”. And, boys and girls, you can easily Deenize the sentences that you use in your very own kitchen, such as “All y’all can bawl your corn in olive awl or wrap it in aluminum fawl”. . Emeril Lagasse: When he says “confectionery sugar’, he really means “confectioners’ sugar”. When he says “pappa-reeka”, he really means “paprika”. When he says “inside of”, he really means “in”. When he says “a little”, he really means “a lot”. Have you ever tried to count the number of times he says “a little” during any given show? Don’t – it will drive you nuts. When he says “cardamin”, he really means “cardamom”. When he says “my water don’t come seasoned”, what he really means is “I need a new joke writer”. When he says “that www dot food thing”, he really means “I flunked Computerese 101”. . Iron Chef Morimoto: When he says “Foo Netwu”, he really means “Food Network”. . Dessert Dude Jacques Torres: When he says “I going”, he really means “I am going”. (The verb “to be” has apparently been deleted from the French language.) . Spit Boy Jamie Oliver: When he says “whack it in the oven”, he really means “I am into hot, kinky stuff”. When he says “Bob’s yer uncle”, what he really means is “you’d better ask your aunt how well she REALLY knew that mailman named Robert”. When he says “rocket”, he really means “an older weapon being used in Iraq”. When he says “Fewd Netwuk”, he really means “Food Network”. . Numerous chefs: When they say “codfish” and “tunafish”, what they really mean is “cod” and “tuna”, respectively. Please note that they use these terms so that you don’t go out and buy “codanimal” or “tunavegetable” by mistake. Having said that, I have no clue as to why they don’t refer to “troutfish”, “salmonfish”, “red snapperfish”, etc., etc. . Giggly-Wiggly Rachael Ray: When she says “EVOO”, she really means “don’t use BOCO (boring old corn oil)”. When she says “a little lettuce action going on”, she really means “with only 8 minutes left in the game, cabbages are still in the lead, but lettuces are making a strong comeback”. . Two Fat Ladies: When they say “I gwing”, they really mean “I am going” or “Sorry, but we have been watching too many episodes of Jacques Torres’ show”. . Please note that the above is not all-inclusive. If there are other celebrity chef words or phrases that have you stumped, please post an ""ISO"" message in the discussion forums and I will find the translation for you.",Contributor,4.5,Christmas Island,2001-11-01,0,185,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/sushi.png,2873

Wondering about my public name? It's a joke between a friend and me ... a twist on J. Lo (singer/actress Jennifer Lopez) - not that I can sing or anything! I am a nurse by profession but I am currently an at-home Mom. I will be taking my nursing refresher course this winter (January 2008), so I will be combing through the 'Zaar files looking for good make-aheads and crockpot friendly meals. I don't have a particular favourite cookbook, other than the one I've compiled for myself. I do, however, enjoy looking through cookbooks for inspiration. I've taken many of my favourite recipes and saved them on disc; as I find more good ""make agains"" I add them to my collection. I have also found many excellent recipes here on 'Zaar. Thank-you, all, for your wonderful contributions! I enjoy Highland and Irish dancing, learning about new cultures, sewing, gardening, camping and, of course, cooking and baking! We have hosted young Korean students for the past few years and I have really acquired a taste for Korean cuisine. Most of it is quite spicy-hot, but, like many asian foods, there is a nice balance of other flavours (sweet, sour, salty) happening also. Try it sometime! As for rating recipes; I follow the 'Zaar guidelines rather than making up my own - it just takes the guesswork out for those reading the reviews.",Contributor,4.7,,2006-08-01,0,5,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/burger.png,8650

Since 1997 I've lived in the beautiful mountains of western NC, where I spend way too much time at work and not nearly enough time camping! I have a partner of 15 years (Lee) and 3 kids--2 grown and 1 teenager still at home. Lee doesn't cook, but she's my cooking cheerleader, and she and my son will always at least try anything I make, no matter what. Camping is one of my favorite things to do. Other favorite ways to spend my time are doing beadwork, knitting, and making homemade soap. I should also admit that I spend waaaay too much time on the internet, but the bright side of that is that it brought me to Zaar! I spend a ridiculous amount of time here, but I love every minute of it. It's also has helped cure me of my pathological cookbook buying. I used to call cookbooks with full-page glossy photos my food porn. ;-) Now, thanks to all the talented photographers here, I can get all the food porn I want! I love to read recipes, which most of my friends think is just weird. I suspect, though, that a lot of you don't think it's weird at all! I love to cook, but only when I want to. I also love to entertain and wish I had time to do more of it. I love trying new recipes. I was a vegetarian (vegan, actually) for several years, and that's when I got hooked on trying so many different cuisines. I still love vegetarian foods, but I do eat some meat, fish, and dairy/eggs now. I still try to keep it healthy and eat as little processed food as possible, but I'm not totally strict about it. Sometimes I want some good old junk food--I just try to make it home-made junk, so at least I know what's in it! My pet peeve is willful ignorance.

I love to hike & take my dogs out for walks. I go out in the 10 person voyageur canoe our Paddling Club acquired this year maybe once or twice a week, with as few as 4 and a maximum of 10 paddlers. We have yet to do a big organized trip, maybe next year when the club's better established. Love to workout at our gym, and instruct cardio step classes as of this year (2008). Life's organized around one hubby, 2 dogs, & 2 cats. Just lost my 13 year old cat who I have as an icon on one of my cookbooks to old age, which has been a sad experience. That's my dog Neige you see as my icon. My culinary influences include Molly Katzen (Moosewood cookbooks), Taste of Home, flipping through magazines, Simmering Suppers (one-pot meals from Harrowsmith Kitchens)and Rose Reisman Brings Home Light Pasta, which was a fundraising project for the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation. Hunting out recipes is my favourite part of food prep. whether it's being on the zaar or having nose in cookbook. I'm not the only recipe lover in the world but I know lots of people cook and bake without directions and create their own beautiful dishes. Some can look at a recipe and decide how to modify it to their own liking. Some never make the same thing twice, some make the same things over and over. I love when I finally have a recipe down pat, down by ""heart"", and I think I'm a pretty good cook; I have a style that infuses my cooking even though I can't back off far enough to get a real sense of that style, and I think love and wisdom and calmness and other good qualities permeate my dishes. Maybe a love for adventure, the unknown, flavours the food I prepare, since that's reflected in my choice to try new recipes all the time. A love for people may come through reflecting my interest in who the author is of the recipe I'm using. I like knowing something about them, even if it's just where they're from which is usually pretty accessible information either from the cookbook or the Zaar or magazines. My love for home, homelife, my devotion to the ones I love, the ones I cook and bake for, surely that's an essential ingredient in my dishes.",Contributor,4.5,Canada,2002-12-01,19,11,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/drink.png,1269

I enjoy cooking, cross stitching, and LOVE NFL Football - GO BUCS - GO PATS! UPDATE: 2/8/2008 My friend Bruce introduced me to Recipezaar. We used to play a game called Randomization where he would hit the randon recipe button, and whatever came up - I would have to make. For some of you who have read my reviews, this may make more sense to you now. Bruce refused to let me use his name - he preferred to remain anonymous so I used the name Herkimer for him instead, much to his chagrin. Shockingly, Bruce died Aug 28, 2007. He was the light of my life. I haven't cooked in a while - certainly nothing like I did when we would play. I can't believe he's gone - I miss him so much. Things just really aren't the same. The last randomization recipe that I completed was Oranges in Caramel Syrup Recipe #175594 - I delivered them to him on the Friday morning before he died on Tuesday night. Saturday mornings we would play the game, if I had completed the recipe from the previous randomization. The last Saturday we played I received Chick Pea and Tomato Curry Recipe #274313. I never made it. He knew I was sick of the idea of having to eat Chick Peas because I don't like them. He was so pleased with himself - his mantra for the game was He couldn't be happy until I was unhappy because he knew I was such a picky eater - anything Green or a Vegetable was a challenge. Let me assure you that after all the moaning and groaning I did over that recipe - he must have died a very happy man. I told him at the funeral home, some people will do anything to get out of eating Chick peas.",Contributor,3.9,212,2005-05-01,0,1,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/drink.png,4860

91438,809592,https://www.food.com/user/809592,Elie de Combys,"Please note that my name isn't Ellie, an English female name, but Élie, a French male name.   Here's a snippet of my life story : I was a music student in college, but had to drop out because of multiple sclerosis. And believe it or not, this has a lot to do about the things I'll be posting here from now on.   Indeed, years before my diagnosis I realized that gluten really didn't do it for me. It made me feel ill, in hard-to-desribe ways. My celiac antibodies test came back negative, though, so I started eating it again. And that's when the MS hit full force. So, needless to say, I stopped again. Since then, I learned that it was not my imagination : gluten plays a role in autoimmune disease. So I stay away from it.   My adventures with foods started in 2007, when I first noticed how sick I was becoming. I explored a whole lot or diets or lifestyles, including paleo, ayurvedic, gluten/casein/soy-free, ketogenic, chemical-free, and so on. All of these have taught me things, and I kept the habits that made me feel well. In fact, I have recently seen studies about MS that confirmed a lot of my intuitions and encouraged me to apply some principles even firmer : my grocery bag is now 100% organic, since a lot of the pesticides used in modern agriculture can have a neurotoxic effect (actually, that's why they kill pests), which is a risk I'll avoid with all my might, since MS is neurologic.   Other things that influence my way of eating are my political and ethical views. As they say, buying is voting. So I weigh the impact of (almost, I'm not perfect) every purchase I make. But I'm on a very low buget, since I'm not apt to work, and that also comes into account, and explains my mostly vegan diet. Indeed, cooking vegan from scratch and whole foods is the less expensive way of eating organic, but I am by no means a true vegan, and as much as I admire their dedication and recognize the positive social impacts of veganism, I'm more of a believer in small scale, humane and organic (or better : holistic) agriculture.   I also have a passion for traditional Quebecois (Quebecker) food, which is my cultural heritage, and Syrian cuisine, which is my mom's culture (and so a little part of mine).   So, what I post might be a little erratic if you consider it from the modern trends perspective. And my older posts might not be consistent with what I'll be posting in the future. But still, what is consistent is that I post only the recipes I have tested and perfected myself, with the help of the hungry mouths that lurk into my appartment.",Contributor,5.0,"Quebec City, 0",2008-04-01,0,0,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/burger.png,9599

Consequently, I spend more time collecting new recipes than actually cooking them. I probably have 3000 recipes sorted into my private cookbooks here on Recipezaar. I figured that my house could only hold so many cookbooks but not so when I collect recipes online. :) Speaking of books, I'm a voracious reader and I probably buy at least 10 books a week by swapping books on http://paperbackswap.com, http://bookmooch.com and http://titletrader.com. My husband, Mike, likes to build furniture and he regularly has to build me more bookshelves. :) I'm self employed as a Real Estate Agent. Nothing beats being your own boss! I used to be a missionary in Ethiopia and Haiti were I started and managed several orphanages and international adoption programs. I also created and did the computer programming for the Precious in HIS Sight Adoption photolisting at http://precious.org but sold it in 2005. I live in College Station, Texas. I'm originally from Houston, Texas and I'm one of the rare people who enjoys moving. We seem to move about every 4 years because of my husband's job (he works for Trane air conditioning). I'm very involved at my church mentoring inner city kids. I believe that the purpose of life is to glorify God and I do that by helping others and evangelism. My favorite Christian TV program is The Way of the Master with Kirk Cameron and Ray Comfort. Their website is at http://wayofthemaster.com. I love to travel and since my husband travels 2/3 of the time with his engineering job, our agreement is that I get to use his frequent flyer miles.

91700,386849,https://www.food.com/user/386849,Munchkin Mama,"Hi! I'm so glad you've made it over to my little corner of RecipeZaar. I just love this site- I find it very theraputic and fun to surf for new recipes. My favorite ones are quick and easy and yet use a minimum of convenience items. Oh, and they have to taste yummy enough to serve my hungry munchkins!! I have two great little ones, a boy and a girl, which I affectionately refer to as ""the smalls"". I stay at home with them every day while my wonderfully loving and perfect-for-me husband works hard for us. Besides loving to cook, I also love to sew (simple projects- a seamstress I am not) and crochet. No afghans or doilies here, just cute little dolls and sometimes baby slippers or hats. I like to make quick things- they give the instant gratification I need!! I love to cook and I really love Recipezaar! I am glad to have met so many nice people through this site. I have a couple of family members that also love RecipeZaar: my sister cass and sam http://www.recipezaar.com/member/663171 and my mom is pondfrogs http://www.recipezaar.com/member/148840. Together we scour these pages for the best and yummiest RecipeZaar has to offer. Here's how I rate recipes I've tried. 1. I do not like to give one or two stars, and I especially dont like to give them unless I know I followed the recipe correctly. 1. I would consider any rating that I give 3 stars or better to be a ""good"" recipe. 2. Any recipe that I give a ""4"" my husband and I really enjoyed and I would definitely make again. 3. Any recipe that I give a ""5"" is an exceptional recipe that I wouldnt want to live without. I also consider the time to make and how easy it was to prepare. For example, even if a recipe was ""very good"" (which is 4 stars according to Recipezaar), I might rate it 5 stars because it tasted great, was easy, and didnt take a long time to make. When cooking I try to avoid convenience foods when possible. It seems like people are on either one side of the fence or the other when it comes to this. As for me, I feel like I am cheating when I use canned soup or a pre-made ingredient. It's generally healthier and less expensive, so I try and stick with the real stuff. Lately I am a one-armed cook, with my boy on my hip and my girl swinging away in her infant swing. My little guy loves to help me cook. I pull a chair up to the counter and he is my little assistant. Really he makes more of a mess than anything, but he sure does enjoy himself! I have done a lot of freezer cooking, which I really enjoy and have found to be a real convenience. I am a strong advocate for breastfeeding and have been either breastfeeding, pregnant, or both for the past 3 years. It is so important for little munchkins to get the nutrition that they need! :) We are Christians and try to live according to the principles of the Bible. I want to be my husband's crowning glory and my kids to grow up knowing Jesus Christ and all He has done for us. My hearts desire is to be a genuine person who makes a difference, even if just in my little corner of the world. A few months ago my Mom (her 'zaar name is Pondfrogs) was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 46. My Grandma (her Mom) died at an early age of the same form of breast cancer, and my husbands mom is also a survivor. So, I feel very blessed to be in good health and try to keep in perspective that we are only on this earth for such a short while. That's why It is so important to know Jesus as Savior, because He is the only way to Heaven! Thank you for visiting my little page. I sure hope that you try and enjoy my recipes :). Take comfort in knowing that I wont post one publicly unless I've tried it and consider it Recipezaar-worthy.",Contributor,4.6,,2006-11-01,15,37,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/drink.png,854

My favorite cookbook is Patti Labelle's Recipes to sing about. It is filled with great comfort food (no diet anything in this book). I love both to cook and bake, November and December are the best times in my kitchen. I was raised in a household with 4 generations, so it was customary for the women to spend endless hours cooking and baking. My great grandmother taught me how to bake using a wood burning stove. That is how we made all of our meals until I was about 14 years old.

It's a lot of fun and everything tastes so good! But when you're out in the fresh air, even burnt hot dogs are great.

The Beau and I get to take his car out once in a while for autocross and basically drive like speed demons and not get in trouble. I love driving in general and am one of the few nutz who enjoys shopping for cars. But I also love to cook. Believe it or not, my mom doesn't think I can cook. But she couldn't cook, so that's probably how she got on that track. My sister and I were latchkey kids and learned to help in the kitchen at a young age and I consider cooking a great outlet for my creative bits. I work full time but am in school on and off part time, plus try to keep up with current events and life in general, plus teach a weekly class to my co-workers, plus just hanging out with The Beau and all our good friends. Oh and I also pet/house-sit -- I used to do it for friends but recently hired on with a ""company"" and am now kinda one of their contractors.

I was born and raised a city girl, but now reside in the country. I love the slower pace of life. I have been married for over 30 years to my wonderful husband and friend. We enjoy spending as much time as possible with our families and friends. Growing up with loving parents and a large family (10 including me), we were one big happy family. Our families are very close today, and we get together monthly to celebrate everyone's birthday. I volunteer at a local hospital, and enjoy boating, golfing, and reading. I love to cook, but my passion is baking. I found recipezaar a few months ago, and found so many delicious recipes. We get together with our families often, and since all of us like to cook, we share new recipes along with the tried and true.

I am married to my best friend, we have two kids and have been married?10 1/2 years. We are not fussy eaters except the hubby hates beets. I can live with that one thing. I grew up on a mixed ranch just east of the Sask/AB border south of Lloydminster. I grew up around horses and cattle. I love going home back to the animals and the farm. I spent a lot of my childhood with my grandma. She was a wonderful baker who went through the depression, I learned so much from her from her experiences. I love making her ""heritage"" recipes, brings my childhood back for my children and my brothers who enjoyed the treats. Her Blueberry muffin recipe is one of my absolute favorite. When I was still at home I was put in charge of meals at harvest time from the time I was old enough to use the stove. I loved coming home from school to make a big meal to haul out the field. All my friends when home to sit in front of the tv and I stood at the stove. I grew up in the local 4-H club, spent 10 years as a member. I am still a huge supporter of our club and very proud of its history. My mom and I organized a 50th Anniversay cookbook in 1997. It is probably my most used paper cookbook...zaar being my most used online of course. I love to can. I started with Aunt Lori's salsa a few years ago. I have expanded to jams, jellies, pickles,..whatever catches my eye at the time. I am a berry picker and love that fresh fruit to make the homemade jams and jellies. Being raised in Sask we have the opportunity to pick a variety of wild berries...Saskatoons, pincherries, chokecherries, strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, thorn apples, gooseberries,currents...we have picked them all. I will rarely post anything less than a 4 star review and most of the time just won't post a review until I have tried the recipe a second time. It could be my error.

Do not email me your nasty messages about it or have you and your recipe posting buddies harass me because I say your recipe isn't traditional.

I love the fact that real people review these recipes and add their own hints and tips. My son has recently (Sept 8, 2003)started the ketogenic diet for his epilepsy so I'm learning how to disguise cream and oil and how to make miniscule portions look bigger. It's an interesting challenge. As of Februaury 27, 2004 there has been no improvement in my son's seizures so we have have decided to stop the diet. We have to stop the diet gradually though so it will be about two months before he can eat regular food again. There is one more medication we can try and after that our last option is a VNS (vagal nerve stimulator). It is similar to a pacemaker but for the vagal nerve in your neck instead of for the heart. Wish us luck! Update Feb 2005- Well, my son had the vns implanted in June 2004 and it hasn't stopped the seizures but it did make them shorter (30-45 seconds instead of 2 to 2 1/2 minutes).

A recipe is merely words on paper; a guideline, a starting point from which to improvise. It cannot pretend to replace the practiced hand and telling glance of a watchful cook. For that reason feel free to stir your own ideas into any dish. When you cook it once, it becomes yours, so personalize it a bit. Add more of an ingredient you like or less of something you don?t like. Try substituting one ingredient for another. Remember words have no flavour, you have to add your own! My need to experiment and want to cook tasty meals came to me after being diagnosed Celiac in December of 1999. What would I have done without the Zaar?

He is an exceptional man as he loves to cook with me. He is a very patient and loving man and understands me far better than anyone I know. He has two sons, Ben and Barrie, that are wonderful young men, who have accepted me in their lives as a stepmom. And now they have made me a grandma.

I homeschool my boys during the day, and I enjoy cooking with them. I love cooking and trying new things. I like fast, easy recipes for dinner, but I also like more complicated, elegant dishes. We entertain often, so I am always looking for something new to fix. I sent several recipes into the Pillbsbury Bakeoff Contest a few years ago, so I spent a month or so inventing recipes. I will post those here soon. :) I have a son who was born 3 months premature (26 weeks gestation) and is now too skiney (at 6 years old) and sensetive to the texture of his food. I always like finding high calorie foods that he will actually eat! In my ""spare time"" (ok, 1 night per week!), I design and maintain a website: SeriousMoms.com. I LOVE this site. I look forward to working on it every week. I've made several pages on my site that link to many Zaar recipes--like my Cupcakes page, and my Christmas Gift Ideas, and Recipes for Romantic Dates at Home. :) Lately, I've been enjoying ""The Sneaky Chef"" with my kids. It WORKS! :) They like all of the recipes so far!! For fun, I also enjoy scrapbooking. I'm currently working on my daughter's baby album. We love adoption! We've adopted 2 of our kids--Noah (3) and Ruby (our baby). It's not always easy, we have struggles (we didn't get Noah 'til he was 14 months, so he has a lot of anger built up in him), but we love it nonetheless. It is a blessing to us to be able to see these kids grow, and to not know what they're going to look like or be like, and to just fall in love with how different they are from us & how those traits never could've come from us. :)",Contributor,4.4,,2007-06-01,0,1,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pie.png,446

She loves to steal Gizmo's toys and hide them from him. Gizmo was rescued from a breeder by our neighbor's kids.

We eat a lot of ethnic food in our house - especially as the area we live in has few good restaurants - most are chain stores.

I work as an administrative assistant in a primary school. I have liked cooking since I was a little girl, strangely enough, my mother never really enjoyed cooking, so I don't know where I am getting it from. Cooking is really taking a break for me (at least of my two boys will leave me to it). I try to involve my kids as much as possible in cooking and they already enjoy making cookies, cakes and popsicles. I like to bake so when it's their birthday I let them choose their favourite cake. This year I made a pirate ship for the youngest one and a treasure chest for my oldest. I am active in my children's school and I like to craft when there's time left, which isn't too much lately. Every night before I go to bed, I need to read at least a chapter in a book. It has become such a ritual that it is hard to sleep when I haven't. I do have quite a few cookbooks, but the ones I would miss the most if I'ld lost them (even if I don't make that much recipes out of them) are my great grandmothers cookbooks, which are partly just little pieces of paper with a recipe scribbled onto it. I also really like the cookbooks and tv-shows of Jamie Oliver and Nigela Lawson. I really like the countryside, even if I don't really live in it.

Remember, be careful what you say, you might find yourself in the second paragraph of page 150, or thereabouts. In October, 2007 my youngest sister, Marie lost her battle with ALS. In her memory, therefore, I post the following: SISTERS Time passes. Life happens. Distance separates. Jobs come and go. Love waxes and wanes. Hearts break. Parents die. Careers end. Life happens ... BUT...... Sisters are there, no matter how much time and how many miles are between you. When you have to walk beside one dear to you in that lonesome valley, the women in your life will be on the valley's rim, cheering you on, praying for you, pulling for you, intervening on your behalf. They will walk beside you, share your sorrow and share your tears, knowing all the while God is there with you, to give you the strength and faith you need and the everlasting blessings of healing love. BE THE CHANGE YOU WANT TO SEE HAPPEN IN THE WORLD (M. Gandhi) IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO BECOME WHAT YOU HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO BE (Georges Eliot) THAT WHICH WE PERSIST IN DOING BECOMES EASIER, NOT THAT THE TASK ITSELF HAS BECOME EASIER, BUT THAT OUR ABILITY TO PERFORM IT HAS IMPROVED.

I have been married for 32 years and when we were newly weds my DH encouraged me to cook even though we would drink Alka-Seltzer for dessert most nights. I thought because I watched my mother cooking when I was growing up that I could just ?jump in? and start cooking. That was not the case. Chris and I found out the hard way. I have two little dogs Jake and Jillian. Jakie is a Japanese Chin and Jillian is a Pekinese. They are so adorable. They race from one end of the house to the other. Jake will watch for me from the front windows. The minute he hears the garage door he makes a beeline for the door with Jillian in tow. Such a nice welcome home at the end of the day. About a year and half ago my friends and I set up a Dinner Club which consists of three couples. Each month one couple hosts a dinner party. The hosts prepare the main entr?e. The guests bring an appetizer and a dessert. The only rule is that all recipes must be new. Tried and true reicpes are not acceptable. This way we get to prepare recipes for friends that we may never have tried. We rate the recipes at the end of the meal and share copies with each other. This affords us a chance to get together without letting too much time go by. Since joining Zaar a year ago I was adopted for the Spring 2008 Pick A Chef cookbook. Some of my recipes appear in the book. I am currently participating in the Zaar World Tour 4, visiting many countries and cooking a lot of foreign recipes along with my teammates. So far this has been very exciting. Again, trying new recipes that I would never have thought to cook has been amazing not to mention meeting people from around the world. This is a wonderful site with so much going on. The recipes I have tried to date have been fabulous. All the members are so nice and helpful.

Once on my grandmothers farm when we were on the back of the wagon of fresh peas I ate too many and got (I thought deathly) sick and another time when my mother made pea soup. Mom was a great cook, made everything from scratch, but this time she left a steel wool scrubber in the bottom of her soup pot and when my sister saw it we started to laugh.

94089,298757,https://www.food.com/user/298757,packeyes,"New wonderful site I just discovered: I am married to a wonderful man who gave me a premium membership for my birthday. As he said, he gets the biggest benefit from this membership, for $25 a year he gets to eat at a gourmet restaurant every night - our table :) I love trying new recipes. During the day, when I have to be away from my kitchen, I spend my time teaching 8th graders math. This summer I am looking forward to making recipes from the veggies in my garden - especially tomato sauces. Last year I made quite a bit of spaghetti sauces. Now that I've made spaghetti sauce from scratch I can't touch that stuff from the super market! This summer I want to find some pizza sauce recipes. If you know of any good recipes for preserving fresh veggies let me know! I have 3 cats who come running to the kitchen every time they hear a can open because they think it's cat food. The black one is Leila, The orange one is Sundrop (also known as Grover) and the gray one is Mist. Mist does not get along with the other 2 at all (she is old and set in her ways and didn't like to meet 2 new cats when my husband and I got married) so this picture is amazing that they are all that close and not fighting! They are very spoiled kitties. http://www.recipezaar.com/members/home/298757/IMG_6280.jpg We also adopted a greyhound this past February. She is a rescue from the race track, though she doesn't have a racing history. If you are looking for a perfect, easy maintenance dog, rescue greyhounds are it! She was already crate-trained - so we don't have to worry about messes in the house. All she does is sleep and go out for walks with us. Even the kitties have warmed up to her. I am always looking for new efficient tricks in the kitchen. My favorite kitchen ""gadget"" is my garlic grinder I got for Christmas. Recipezaar has become my favorite website and 90% of the recipes I cook come from here. I am enjoying writing my recipes down. I am the type of person who just throws some of this and some of that in to cook together and it usually turns out good so it can be difficult actually narrowing down the amounts - if you use one of my recipes keep that in mind and please adjust to your tastes! I am trying to get away from using the word ""delicious"", my husband pointed out to me that I use that word to describe every recipe I try. I can not cook without garlic, any recipe I try out that does not have garlic I add it in (except desserts). The way I rate recipes: 5 stars - stellar, this recipe will be added into my weekly dinner rotation. 4 stars - very good, either my husband or I really liked it but the other one just thought it was okay. 3 stars - okay, I will make it very occasionally. 2 & 1 stars - I don't rate many recipes this low, but I will if I followed all the steps exactly and it was not something we were able to finish eating. I usually try to put in my rating how I changed the recipe - this usually entails adding garlic. I am trying to cook healthy and yet still delicious. I buy all organic meats and dairy and I try to on produce. I am very wary of all the hormones and additives put in food and ultimately would like to cook everything from scratch - although I know this is a pipe dream at this point in my life. I detest fast food, I really believe that fast food is ruining the health of the majority of America (that and T.V. - but I won't get started on that).

I love cookbooks, I don't really have a favorite one, more like a favorite 10. I like to take a recipe and find the variations in other cookbooks and mix things up. My husband, who is from Austin, Texas, likes things spicy and a little wild. But I tend to keep things a little mild. My sons like the fact that there is always something new on the table. We eat as a family every night no matter what. If there is something that my kids don't like, there is always hot pockets....lol. I love to cook mostly on the stove top.

My favorite cooking appliance in the entire world is my Faberware stand alone pressure cooker. I can’t believe that pressure cookers are not more popular since they are not the unsafe exploding variety anymore. I love to quickly throw in a bunch of ingredients and push the cooking time and walk away. I come back less than an hour later and I have a wonderful dish that tastes like it’s been cooking all day long. My husband loves to cook on his big green egg smoker. I have also been experimenting with smoked veggies and they are incredible! I own quite a few cookbooks, and I’m always looking for great recipes that will become standards. My current culinary goal is to compile my “keep and remake” recipes into my own binder which I can easily refer to when I need prepare something. I want to become organized with my recipes and I don’t want my husband to say how come you never made that great lasagna ever again and I have to say I have no idea where the recipe is! I'm an avid gardener and have been growing my one herbs and increasing the number I have each year.

My mother, a talented lady, taught herself to cook after she got married and turned out to be a wonderful cook. People everywhere rave about her meals. I am especially fond of the few traditional Polish dishes she makes. These days that only happens by special request. :o) When I was 18, I married into a Greek/Macedonian family and so my love of food was further expanded and enhanced. Those people can cook! Now married for a 2nd time to a true-blue Aussie guy, I struck gold again with a mother-in-law who was extremely talented in her kitchen. Unfortunately she's too elderly and unwell to weild her wooden spoon these days but I thoroughly enjoy discussing her favourite recipes and perusing her old cook books. Food has always been a huge part of my life. I love all types of cuisines. Hubby and I have 7 kids (his, mine and ours). At present (2010), they are 26, 26, 25, 24, 20, 11 & 9 years old. I get to practice in the kitchen a lot. Sometimes more than I really want to. LOL! The 5 older kids are no longer living at home but phone me with foody requests regularly. I LOVE it when they ask for a favourite dish to be cooked by me. I feel my job has been well done. :o) My 2 younger kids are a Mum's nightmare to feed. I don't know why, but these 2 are by far the pick-iest eaters of the 7. Still, they are asked to try new things regularly and I'm sure one day, they too will have a love of good food as the rest of us do.

I'm Kookaburra, from Australia. First, a promise. I will only post recipes on this site which I've made myself and to which I would personally give a 5 star rating - what you give them is up to you ;-) I look forward to receiving your feedback. If you look at my reviews, they're all 5 stars. That doesn't mean I give 5 stars to every recipe I try. I'm just not interested in giving poor ratings to anyone else's recipe because I accept that different people have different tastes. So, I've decided that I'll only review those recipes which I really love and which I'd make again and recommend to friends. If a recipe meets that criteria - even if it needs a bit of 'tweaking' to match my tastes, I'll give it 5 stars. If not, I'll just delete it from my recipe book and no hard feelings. I'm not advocating this as the 'right' approach. I just decided I needed a consistent strategy for rating and this is mine. I'm passionate about cooking - and eating! What I look for in food is something that 'zings' in the mouth. I like lots of taste - I'm not a big fan of subtlety. I don't often cook recipes exactly as written. I like to experiment and adapt things to my own taste. A retired marketing executive and academic, I live with my elderly (but thoroughly modern) mother in a tiny mountain village at the edge of the rainforest. I'm female, happily single, in my mid-40s and boast the Rubenesque figure of a passionate cook! Avalon, our 'story-book' cottage, overlooks a small lake. As I sit at my computer or work in the kitchen, I'm serenaded by a cacophany of native birds - including a very fat family of kookaburras! We have quite a large property and are lucky to have vegetable gardens and a variety of fruit and nut trees. I look forward to sharing recipes on Recipezaar with family, friends and friends I've yet to meet. last minute flight",Contributor,4.7,224,2004-01-01,2,20,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pie.png,1509

94713,396078,https://www.food.com/user/396078,MarthaStewartWanabe,"My name is Rebecca, but my family and friends call me Becky. I am 33 years old and live in Rochester, New York, USA. I am a life-long resident of Western New York and can't say as I'd ever want to live anywhere else. I grew up on a small dairy farm in rural Western New York and love country living. Although my husband and I live in a suburb right now, we hope someday to move back to our roots and live a peaceful country life. My husband and I have been married for 10 years.  We have a beautiful 5-year-old daughter and a 3-year-old son.  I am amazed at how quickly our kids are growing and developing.  I read a lot about and hold my own personal skepticism regarding the affects of additives such as preservatives, hormones, artificial colorings, artificial sweeteners, caffeine, allergens, etc.  With the increasing number of children and adults with food allergies, I am suspicious that the last century of our nation's food industry improvements have contributed.  I'm doing the best I can to protect my family from the risks, but it is difficult to avoid every additive.  I have friends and family with food allergies and know how difficult it is to cope with food restrictions. I enjoy the challenge of cooking for those with food allergies but can't imagine making it an every-day affair. I love to cook and entertain for family and friends. It's a great joy for me to serve them delicious, creative dishes. I always anticipate their feedback when they try something I've made. My favorite and most-utilized recipe source is Food.com, and I also have an extensive collection of cookbooks.  I enjoy exploring new cooking techniques and experimenting with various ethnic cuisines. I am an avid viewer of Food Network and the Cooking Channel, always looking for new and interesting ideas. I work at a nursing home as an Executive Assistant to the President and Administrator. I love my job. I coordinate board functions, do secretarial work in the Administration Office and supervise Reception as well as enjoy building relationships with the elders. Because coworkers and elders know cooking and baking is my passion, I have earned a reputation. My boss and I have done a cooking program with the elders, where we involved them in making simple dishes and sharing with the rest of the elders in their household. I have done a baking program, where we baked a different type of cake each month to celebrate the elders' birthdays which take place that month. I have been involved in special neighborhood luncheons where the staff in our neighborhood cooks for and serves a small group of elders. I am also part of a Dining Team, which is a group of staff from all disciplines who are exploring ways to make the elders' dining experience more home-like (cooking on the households, having a continental breakfast cart available daily, liberating restricted diets, etc.).  And then of course there are staff potlucks throughout the year. Cooking and baking with the elders brings them so much joy and comfort, as it helps to make the nursing home feel a little more like home. It's amazing what the aroma of food cooking and fresh-baked goods can do for the mind and soul! I identify cooking with feelings of accomplishment, peace of mind and reminiscence. My favorite childhood memories involve cooking with my mother and grandmothers. We would enjoy one another's company while cooking for family gatherings. It was always a family effort harvesting, canning and freezing vegetables and fruit in the summer/fall. I wasn't aware at the time, but I was learning generations of recipes and family cooking traditions that would carry through my life and hopefully eventually through my children.  We are doing our best to raise them with an appreciation for good, fresh and healthy food and different cooking techniques.  My kids have a play kitchen set and pretend to cook and feed baby dolls while I prepare meals. My daughter is very interested cooking, so I have begun involving her in meal preparation and baking projects.  She even has her own rolling pin, two aprons and a mini whisk!  She LOVES spending time with me in the kitchen, plus she is ever so adorable in her apron. Food.com has given me much joy. I first visited the website in search of a quick chicken recipe and have been hooked ever since, recommending the site to my friends and family. I enjoy posting my recipes and anticipate other viewers' reviews and ratings. The website has encouraged me to become more inventive in the kitchen. Some mad scientist attempts are successful, whereas others may flop. But I have realized you'll never know unless you try! Fortunately, I have my loving and tolerant husband as my primary critic and sometimes unfortunate guinea pig.

The people are wonderful and the community is rural enough to give my children the childhood I want them to enjoy. I got my passion of cooking from my step mom she is an amazing cook who can improvise any meal and have it come out wonderful. I have no idea how she does it but its what I aspire to achieve. I stumbled across recipezaar by accident a few years ago while acquainting myself with the internet and have been addicted ever since. This cooking community of people just amaze me. I have been welcomed with a warmness that is unsurpassed. Everyone has shared their recipes, knowledge, humor, the lists goes on and on...U guys are wonderful. I tell everyone I know about this website in hopes of inspiring all of the would be chefs out there to keep experimenting because its doesnt have to be complicated to be yummy. I love preparing a meal that makes my family say make this again mom its great, its a satisfaction that my day to day job does not provide. My pet peeves are lying, selfishness and judgemental people. I am raising my boys to be loving and giving young men. I hope that my love of cooking rubs off on them and that they will remember the times we have shared playing in the kitchen.",Contributor,4.6,"Boise, Idaho",2004-04-01,0,2,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pop.png,5998

My love for humanity is based on fellowship rather than sensuality. I PROMISE that I will never share a recipe unless I have tasted the food. Most of the recipes are mine, but I have included a few classics, and some recipes that were written by very creative people, that are just so good that I had to share. From time to time I have found recipes with my name on them in print magazines, but they are always altered in some way by the publisher. So there is no reason why you should not add your own personal touch. If you leave this page with just one thought, I hope that it would be that Cooking is a Creative Sport. I grew up in Glenview Illinois, just north of Chicago. My Mother loved those little exotic cookbooks, that were sold as a weekly series in grocery stores in the 1950's. I was taught to eat whatever was put on my plate so I ate food from a different culture every week. If I had to pick a favorite, it would be Mediterranean. After leaving my Mother's table, I have lived and enjoyed eating in Colorado, Missouri, Montana and Nebraska, before settling in Saint Cloud, Minnesota in 1975. After a 30 year marriage with mixed reviews, I am now pleasantly single again, and plan to stay that way. Up until recently, I had occupied my evenings just talking with people and sometimes sharing recipes, while soliciting donations for Non-Profit Organizations. Yes .. that's right, for over 20 years, I was a Telemarketer. The perfect job for a Taurus. I enjoy reading cook books the same way most people read novels,and I am still improving my skills in the art of Solo Cooking. However; my true passion will always be sharing my favorite recipes with all of you.",Contributor,4.5,"Saint Cloud, Minnesota",1999-12-01,3,95,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/fruit-kebab.png,3208

We have a rating system for new recipes, and he always lets me know his opinion. Pet peeves include people who are afraid to try new foods and people who are habitually late.

I love baking, especially cookies and scones. We recently bought a raised ranch at the very edge of the city limits - corps of engineer wetland area across the road, city soccer field in my back yard. We live in a town of about 10,000 - a little too big for my liking, but that is alright. It is quiet here, tho. We have 1 cat, Moodie, who is a tuxedo cat. White paws, white bib, otherwise all black, long haired, short-legged with THE LONGEST whiskers I have ever seen on a cat. He is a big baby. My pet peeves are liars and people who will not face reality.

Fireplaces and bonfires. Historical mystery stories. Cookbooks. Anything Victorian. Counted cross stitch. Calligraphy - working on learning this. Tatting lace - want to learn how. Canning and preserving summer's bounty - pickles, jams, jellies . . . . Roses - particularly pink ones. Lace. Candlelight. Garfield. Moonlight. The ocean- living in the Midwest, this is something I LONG for! We lived in New Bedford, Mass. for a while when I was a child. Travelling- I like to go driving. That is, I don't care to drive myself, but I do like to go driving! Really, really good dark chocolate. The color green - in all of its manifestations. Ice hockey - watch, not play! Teddy bears. Sherlock Holmes. Board games - except monopoly. Tea and scones. New England. Long walks in the brisk autumn air. Hot chocolate. Gazing at a starry sky. Optimism. Homemade soup and homemade bread. Christmas music. Quilling. Origami - want to learn this. Learning about new cultures. The way God's word reveals new things every time you read it! Trying new recipes. Comedy. Making Christmas cookies. Update 01/30/2008: I am getting into Indian food now. Never would have thunk it before, but I am very intrigued with it just now.

A keeper. 3 Stars ~ A good idea that is not quite working. Repairs needed May or may not be a keeper. 2 Stars ~ This recipe would need a major overhaul to suit me.

95167,355694,https://www.food.com/user/355694,Stoblogger,"I come from a very large family which attributed to my mother spending a great deal of her time in the kitchen cooking, cleaning, and preparing. I was fascinated at how she prepared wonderful dishes (especially desserts) without using a cookbook. We grew many of our own fruits and vegetables and my summers were spent washing jars and preparing fruit and vegetables for canning. I dreaded the mountains of green beans, tomatoes, peaches, etc., etc. that had to be picked, washed, peeled, snapped.... More than anything, I hated spending my summer washing jars! But now, I wouldn't trade that kind of upbringing for anything. I'm glad I learned how to do all those things because it's becoming a lost art. It really was a simpler time then and I'm a much better person for knowing how to do all those 'old fashioned' things. In my early years of learning to cook, I watched Julia Child on PBS every chance I got. I was so thrilled when I was about 11, my mother let me prepare Julia's Pastry Tarts. If I remember correctly they didn't turn out so well but it didn't matter.

95257,49561,https://www.food.com/user/49561,Smilyn,"As of 21 JUL 2010:  I am so darn disappointed with Recipezaar, now Food.com, again.  I have been with Recipezaar since 2002 and have seen so many different changes that the staff has created.  Each time I get used to it, but these last two times are just ridiculous.  I don't expect perfection from any site, but do expect some standards to be kept in place.  Many Recipezaar-veteran members were disappointed and placed their concerns with the community forums and even wrote to Scripps Network via snail mail.  This new Food.com is just another way to make it commercial like the rest of Scripps Network products.  I used to be really into Food TV and watch it alot, but it is so commercialized... how is it that every Celeb chef has their own knife set?  Really?  Look at Rachel Ray (for an example)... she makes it seem that she is down to Earth, but with her magazine, 4 - 5 TV shows, bakeware, cookbooks, etc. it gets old really quick that Scripps is out for money and hoping to just bank on us.  I'm all about making money and the American dream to make a profit, but does everything need to be so darn commercialized?  I even gave into the paid memberships on Zaar... ugh.  Such a scam, but I did it.  I know things move with the times and I embrace technology more than most, but things don't need to be so commericialized to be high tech.  So I am sure I will end up moving on, saving my recipes on my own computer, thus not sharing with the world.  Sigh.  I know that one less member Scripps has won't even make a dent, but at least I will feel better about it. About me is a whole lot so I'll narrow it down a bit. I love my family: the hubby and two beautiful, spoiled kids. We lived in Vegas for quite a while and moved to Florida. Since it's almost near impossible to have the hubby be an E-6 and me stay at home, I decided to go back to work. I love my husband so much. He never lets us do with-out, he protects us (and the country), he is very smart and he has such a great personality. We are still working on being handy around the house... LOL! He is that one in the party that can get along with almost everyone. He is true Cajun, raised in the deep south of Louisiana, so now I know what real Cajun food is. I really love my job as a gov't contractor. The people here treat me very well. I am truly blessed to have this job. I was previously in the military for 7 1/2 years. I have been to Uzbekistan (in support of OEF) and to Turkey(in support of ONW) (separate trips). I worked in the supply career field and pushed mo bags around (mobility bags carry our chemical warfare gear for deployments). Then I worked at a rescue squadron where I got to go on the 2 deployments above. I loved working there, but my boss was a jerk :) I applied to go into communications and was accepted. I went to school and was seperated from DH for 5 months for tech school :( It was hard. After school, we got pregnant with our DS. Sometimes he can be the sweetest boy. J/k, I love him. I heard boys don't grow out of it. Oh well, I always have my DD (2 years old) I love being on a low carb diet even if my recipes don't show it. 1/2 of them are from my mother-in-law (who happens to be a very good cajun cook) and some are from researching my Danish heritage. Some are because we love the recipe and want to share. I love scrapbooking and putting together my own cookbook from this website. I have over 300 recipes in a binder and I am still collecting. Someday it will be a published book :) I have found so many great ideas, recipes and advice.",Contributor,4.6,212,2002-07-01,3,11,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/drink.png,3798

My first real cooking experience was when I was 7. I came home from school one afternoon and felt like French toast. My elder brother was home with his friends and did not want to make it for me, so I got a pan out, put it on the stove, turned the stove on to high. After that I could not remember what to do, but I knew that French toast involved bread so I put the bread in the hot pan without grease and poured milk over it! Oy vey... My brother's friend asked me what I was trying to make and I told him. He laughed and told me I was making it wrong but he also taught me how to make French toast the right way. I came home every day after that and made French toast. I felt so confident with the little bit of knowledge I had acquired that I soon started experimenting with other things. Nothing was going to stop me! The first full meal I ever made for my family was boiled rice and oven roasted chicken pieces with a steamed vegetable medley. I was 8 years old and my mom was in hospital. My dad was struggling to hold down an intensely busy job, keep the family going and be with my mom, so I thought I would help him. I don't think he believed that I had done it on my own. I remember telling him that I read in a cookery book how to make a roast chicken but I did not know what ""a"" rosemary was so I just put the chicken in the dish without it.

I work in a neighboring town as a small animal veterinarian, part-time. I have a four year old daughter and a 2 year old son. I have two large horses, a miniature horse, one dog and one cat. My husband and I enjoy anything in the out of doors. Besides spending time with family and our animals, my family and I enjoy being involved in our church and spending time with friends. Although many of my recipes posted are of desserts I like to make for family or friends, I have for the last several years ascribed to a healthier lifestyle...eating lots of protein, veggies and fruits. No, I am not a low carber....I eat the right carbs....brown rice, whole wheat bread and all in moderation. I do have several recipes posted that I use often that adhere to these guidelines. When you combine eating nutrient dense foods with monitoring your caloric intake, you can't help but be healthy! There is an awesome free website that you can use along with Zaar to help meet these goals. It is www.calorie-count.com. It takes a day or two to learn how to use it...but it is a fantastic resource for anyone wanting to analyze what they eat and figure out what your caloric expenditures and allowances should be. Like Zaar it also had a wonderful community of people with a common interest...staying healthy while enjoying foods. OK...enough of the plug...but I really do love that website! Zaar has been great for finding recipes that fit this lifestyle...many recipes can simply be modified to be healthy. The variety this gives us has made the difference in getting the whole family to eat that way....that's right...I don't think my daughter has tasted white bread more than two to three times in her life!!! On all four of her birthdays she turned up her nose at the cake I baked her (a once a year exception)....which made me so happy!! So thank you Zaar....for contributing to our healthy lifestyle...couldn't do it without you!!!",Contributor,4.5,,2004-02-01,0,7,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/fruit-kebab.png,4615

95579,91867,https://www.food.com/user/91867,The Giggle Box,"When I was 10 I discovered the joy of cooking on the back of a Nestle Toll house Chocolate Chip bag. It was the first recipe I ever made. I had a blast and it was a lot of fun to cook something that everyone loved. To this day, baking is one of my favorite things to do, and it shows! (that explains the lack of a picture, hehe) On the non-cooking front, I lead a fairly normal life. For the past four and half years I have been able to stay home with my DD and be a full time mom (is there any other kind?). In college I had a wonderful professor, Dr. Mark Woodhouse (his books are fascinating BTW) and I began my study of the paranormal, conspiracy theory, and metaphysics. I can honestly say it changed my life. I earned my degree in Philosophy with a minor in Religion and English. For those of you who are interested in Astrology, I am a Pisces Dragon. A great book (did I mention that I like to read a lot?) is The New Astrology by Suzanne White. She actually sums up my life very well when she says: ""Pisceans born in Dragon years will be touchy and argumentative until they finally stop trying to prove themselves. Then they will become effecient in a chosen profession, stay in a pleasant rut, and cruise around all day dreaming about what to make for dinner.""",Contributor,4.6,United States,2003-06-01,0,10,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pasta.png,3387

I love to get out and ride my bike around town, and taking long walks is my favorite way of relaxing and feeling good.  I'm lucky to live just half a mile from a grocery store, so on nice days I like to take my handy rolling market cart and walk there.  Sometimes I do my best menu-planning while strolling along the sidewalk! My married daughter in San Antonio got my cooking gene for sure.  We love nothing better than getting in the kitchen together when I visit her, or when she comes home.  Holidays are our favorites---we like a pretty presentation and doing the tables, centerpieces, and so forth, as well as trying new recipes and menus.  She's recently added homemade baby food to her repertoire, now that she has a baby boy who lovvvvves to eat. I can't wait 'til he starts having birthday parties; while I don't eat sweets myself, I adore baking. The only sort of cooking I'm not overfond of is grilling out, but that's fine; my husband is the King of the Grill and takes over when we entertain outdoors.  I'm happy to do the appetizers and sides in the INDOOR kitchen! I love Italy and France, and have many recipes scribbled on napkins from my trips there.  I'm in an Italian study group, and the six of us enjoy getting together and trying recipes.  My husband and I are also in a supper club, and each month there's a different theme: one summer we hosted a luau with a variety of tropical dishes, and this past fall I built a menu around a French theme, with hearty boeuf bourguignonne (for my carnivorous friends). I was excited to be chosen Chef of the Day on October 17, 2009, and Chef of the Month in July '12. Thank you, Food.com, and all the friends/fellow cooks I've met here.

You can also find it on facebook at http://www.facebook.com/pages/From-Cupcakes-To-Caviar/207954912556308     I was born in a small war torn village in Siberia in 1728 while my father drank Vodka and my mother loudly cursed my fathers every sexual impulse...wait maybe that was a different lifetime. Hmmm, maybe this is the lifetime where I am Joan of Arc? No, I'm scared of fire and I don't speak French... though I DO love French fries, does that count? How 'bout the one where I am a Samurai...no, let's not. I always crave Sushi and tend to start brandishing butter knives at people when I think about that one. Fineeee...sighhhh, I'll get to the boring realities of this lifetime. I'm a mom of six kids ranging from 25 down to 2 and a half years old as well as five adorable grandchildren and 4 step children. I live in a small city in Kentucky though I am originally from the South Side of Chicago. I live with some of my kids, three psychotic cats and my wonderful husband Russell whom I met online and immediately fell madly in love with. He is also a displaced Chicago native. Using Zaars question about what would I do with a month off, I'd have to say sleep ...nonstop...just feed me chocolate intravenously and wake me when the month was over. My pet peeves are people with a lack of manners and old fashioned common courtesy, people who have no idea what the turn signal is for in their car & as I have a disabled son, those who stereotype the disabled. I am a freelance writer and researcher by trade and sometimes do teen online counseling on the side...I know, weird combo but I'm a fairly weird person.  For fun, I am an avid game player with current addictions to Gardens of Time in Facebook and any decent (I.E. good plot line and not too easy) hidden object game. I'm also a music fanatic who spends way more time than is healthy looking for new music.  I feel blessed also to have met some awesome people here too. This is NOT just a recipe site. That's Russell and me; ignore that I look like crap please?",Contributor,4.7,"Winchester, 56",2003-06-01,0,13,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pie.png,2693

Sometimes I will start out with the ingredients for a particular dish and go off on a tangent and come up with something entirely different.

I am 21 years old and have recently been diagnosed with Celiac Disease.This means that I must maintain a strict gluten free diet, meaning that I can not eat anything with the slightest amount of wheat, rye, oats, or barley.I have a wonderful boyfriend who I love dearly that is so supportive and understanding of my disease. I don't know what I would do without him. I also have a severe peanut & nut allergy, so cooking is quite a challenge at times.Some of my favourite things to do are cooking, scrapbooking, baking,reading, knitting, crocheting, and watching movies. I have just started to get the hang of this tricky gluten free diet. It really is ALOT harder than it seems.But however, I am determined to make the best of it. I very much enjoy cooking and baking, so I have been buying every gluten free cookbook I can get my hands on and every moment I get, I try to test out some of these new recipes. However frustrating and difficult it's been trying to experiment with all these new flours and ingredients, it has been alot of fun, and everytime I find a good reipce, it makes it all worth it. I want to find as many wonderful and delicious gluten free recipes as I can, and post them all on this site. I know how hard it is when you are first diagnosed, and I want to help others who have recently been diagnosed or just others that have celiac disease that need some great gluten free recipes. Celiac disease is something that we have to live with everyday, so it's important that we make the best of it.For sure at least one good thing has come from having Celiac Disease, I have become a better cook and have truly cherished the moments that I spend in the kitchen. All the recipes that I post on this site I have made and I have found to be very good! They are all gluten free! Some of the recipes use special ingredients that you can buy at specialty health stores, and some of them are recipes that you can make with ingredients bought right at your local grocery store. My recipes that use special flours etc. are named starting with gluten free [ex. Gluten Free French Bread], and the recipes that use everyday ingredients end with the word gluten free in brackets [ex. Blushing Apples (Gluten Free)]I hope that you enjoy all of them as much as I have.Cheers!",Contributor,4.6,,2006-02-01,1,72,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/fruit-kebab.png,7808

I baked a lot of home made bread from Betty Crocker's Big Red Book, and every holiday, my mom and I would make pies together from scratch. I didn't actually get interested in cooking main courses until I got married and realized that I had to actually put dinner on the table every night. Just as I was starting to get the hang of it, I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease in May of 2007. This meant that I had to learn a whole new way of cooking - gluten free. I have accepted this as a new challenge and have fallen even more in love with cooking and baking. There is nothing like the feeling I get when I have success with creating a new recipe! My inspiration usually comes from a craving for something that I can't have because it is not gluten free. I immediately go back to my kitchen and learn how to make it myself!

96754,1375473,https://www.food.com/user/1375473,the80srule,"In advance, I'd like to thank everyone who reviews my recipes and leaves positive feedback! I know that I usually don't email anyone after getting a review, so I'd just like to thank everyone who reviews and submits pictures of my recipes in advance. It's much appreciated! I'm an accounting student who likes to believe it's still 1987. I'm trying to cook at home more so I joined up on here to swap recipes and get ideas, namely for someone with a limited budget and a ridiculously tiny cramped kitchenette. It gets hard for me to keep fresh ingredients around due to cost and spoilage, so most of my recipes call for canned stuff, but feel free to ""upgrade"" them with fresh ingredients! :) To update this a bit, I went from someone who was totally inept in the kitchen to a self-taught gourmet chef almost overnight. I'm quite proud of this feat and now look forward to things like grocery shopping and doing most of my cooking one day of the week to freeze and refridgerate stuff for future use, and keeping track of dates and perishability helped with my organizational skills. Cooking lingo looked like a foreign language to me, now I know it just as well as I know EPS and price-to-book ratios! I started out following other 'zaar users' recipes and from cookbooks, other cooking websites, etc. then started building on those to the point where I know enough about food structure and flavors to develop my own recipes. The dishes I'm now famous for are homestyle mac n cheese, mango shrimp, cheesecakes, and lots of pumpkin goodies with luscious buttercream frosting. There's some certain recipes that I'll probably stay away from for time, complexity, and budget limitations but I still didn't think I'd ever be able to make my own frosting or burritos. I like watching the Food Network to get ideas although god I wish I had one of those real kitchens heh. My favorite celebrity chefs are Paula Deen, Guy Fieri, and the Barefoot Contessa. I have a madcap and sarcastic sense of humor, which is evident in some of my postings. Not everyone gets it or just thinks I'm being mean or self-deprecating but I'm really not. I like to take things as they come in life and not take myself too seriously because life's just way too short. I live for the company of my friends, who are basically my family, and other warm, funny, and down-to-earth people. Two-faced people and people who act like they're better than me are unwelcome. Other things about me: I've been in college for almost an entire decade, I'm an old school gaming dork, and I clip coupons and look for savings religiously and however money I save on my purchases, gets contributed to my IRA. Don't think it's an effective strategy? I put $1,042 in there to date if that tells you anything! Ha my friends always tell me how much my accountant super-powers keep coming out off the clock. Although I like to view coupon clipping as more of a game rather than the headaches involved with at-risk rules and limit losses. I love cheese. Cheese is the word. I'm a pesco-vegetarian, so that means I'm always looking for innovative ways to use tofu-- baked, mashed, fried, stir-fried, you name it. I like some vegan foods but could never go vegan because of my love of cheese and I also use milk, butter, and the like frequently in my recipes...but as much as I love things like tofu, tempeh, soymilk, and ricemilk I just do not dig Soy butter and soy cheese. Totally not the same!! I don't eat poultry or red meat not because of moral objections for the way they're obtained, but for health reasons as well as I've just never been a meat eater. (Ever see the nasty conditions chickens are kept in? Yeah...makes me prefer tofu.) Don't like it, and cooking vegetables, cheeses, and vegan-friendly stuff is just far easier. At least if I don't fully cook tofu all the way, it won't make me sick. I'd rather get my proteins through tofu, nuts, legumes, and sometimes shellfish and use the calorie allowance on decandent desserts. (Which I've also gotten really good at making!) I love classic comfort foods like mac n cheese, grilled cheese with tomato soup, and chili cheese fries. I'm a big connoisseur of Mexican and Indian food, and I like to try cuisine from other cultures too. I'm always willing to try new things! My weird food quirks: Tomatoes. I LOVE tomato-based foods like pizza, pasta sauces, ketchup, tomato soup, etc. but will only eat raw tomatoes if sliced paper-thin on some sandwiches or finely, finely diced with Mexican food preferably with some cilantro. I hate them in chunks on salads and can't stand chunky tomato soups and sauces. Same with tomato peels! :: Salad dressings- except for some raspberry vinaigrettes, I totally despise packaged salad dressings. I thought Bolthouse Farms 1000 Island dressing was good at first until it gets that chemical taste a few days after opening. I think almost every store-bought salad dressing has this disgusting chemical or overprocessed taste to it whether it's Kraft or that $8/bottle stuff they sell at Whole Foods. But most salad dressings at restaurants, especially French, 1000 island, and buttermilk? I usually can't get enough! :: I hate, hate, hate mayonnaise but don't mind using it in my cooking and love mayo-based sauces and salad dressings. But plain? Ick. I also use Nasoya soy-based Nayonnaise to cut on fat, calories, and perishability and find that it works just as great if not better. If I could buy Nayonnaise by the crate or economy-size jug that would rule. BEST RESTAURANTS EVER: Jackson Diner, Queens NY: Best Indian food EVER. Menu prices are good considering the huge sharable portions and I get enough for 3 dinners out of the leftovers, but the lunch buffet is an AWESOME deal. Blockheads, various points of NYC: Great low-price Mexican restaurant that has healthier eats than other Mexican places, good drink specials, and just a fun place to be. I've got a lot of good memories of getting drunk with my girlfriends over foot-long burritos at this place. Caliente Cab Co, Murry Hill NYC: It's right next to Blockheads and it's a little more expensive but their margaritas are out of this world and you get heaping portions of awesome food. I highly recommend the bean tostadas and shrimp quesadilla. Kate's Joint, Lower East Side NYC: I've been going to this great vegetarian/vegan restaurant since 2003, I usually always get the Super Veggie Burger, McKate, or the Mock Popcorn Shrimp. I don't know what Abijah's Secret Sauce but it sure is delicious. A particularly funny memory I have of taking one of my friends to Kate's with me is when got inside and she asked the waitress, ""Dude, will Kate share her joints?"" Shady Maple Smorgasbord, East Earl PA: I've been going to PA Dutch Country with my family for vacations for 20 years, maybe farther back if my memory serves me well. Shady Maple's always been there. This place is just awesome. If you go during lunch hours, the buffet is about half the price as dinner and you get the same food. The new building it's in is just amazing-- there's the pizza bar, the steak bar, catch of the day bar, salad bar, 2 dessert bars, classic comfort foods, garden fresh greens, and don't forget their classic whole-wheat rolls with fresh creamery butter! There's something for everyone and even your pickiest kids will find something they love. And you can never go wrong with their shoo-fly pie and red velvet cake, which you can purchase in the Farmer's Market next door to take home. Also, you eat free on your birthday! La Barca, San Francisco CA: My family and I discovered this restaurant by accident in 2001 on a family vacation. At the time, none of us were really into Mexican food but were willing to give it a try because the place looked warm and welcoming and we saw everyone's plates had heaps of food. Well, that turned me on to Mexican food for good! I think La Barca is one of THE best Mexican restaurants in the freakin world. If I'm ever in SF for fun or business again, it's well worth the trip! The prices are unbelievable for the food you get-- and I never saw potato enchiladas anywhere else! The green enchilada is good too.",Contributor,4.4,,2009-09-01,0,21,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/drink.png,4424

I'm a vegetarian, and I try to make environmentally sustainable and socially conscious food choices, using local, organic, and fair trade products whenever possible. I believe that any food experience should be enjoyed holistically, with appreciation for the flavour, texture, smell, and appearance of a dish, and consideration for where the ingredients have come from and the processes they've undergone before arriving in my kitchen. I discovered earlier this year that I have Celiac Disease and a dairy intolerance, so I'm learning new ways to cook and eat in a world full of wheat and dairy.

Twenty years ago, at a cross-road in my life, I had a good sit-down talk with me and decided that my two passions in life were people, and helping them feel better ... and cooking. Just five days after that, a tiny ad in the local paper announced that Massage School started on Monday; so on that Monday in Sept. 1990 a new chapter started in my life. It was like learning a foreign language. Do you know where your olecranon process is? I met Mr. Wonderful in February of 1992 and we married 82 days later. (Who? Me impulsive??) He's still my Mr. Wonderful. In regards to cooking, he's my strongest supporter ... and toughest critic. When we first met, it was Mr. Meat and Potatoes meets Little Miss Vegetarian. In an effort to learn how to live together, we developed this plan: Thursdays became experimental food day. I would cook something that neither one of us had ever had before (so there would be no emotional attachment for either of us) and we would critique it. The deal was that if either of us found that meal gag-worthy, we would eat at McDonald's. I am happy to report, we have not darkened their door yet! Out of those experiments came our most favorite recipes. Ours is a blended family and between us we have three sons: an architect in CA, a computer programmer in FL and an Emergency Room MD in TX. We are blessed with three lovely daughters-in-law [the architect just married an interior decorator! A blessing on their heads, Mazel Tov, Mazel Tov!!] and three very hug-able grandchildren (18 y/o boy, 13 y/o girl and 11 y/o girl.) We are both very active in our congregation. If you like, check us out at http://www.kolhamashiach.org. We teach as well as other avenues of ministry (think: sanitation and maintenance!) ... Fun around here includes ministering ;) at the local department stores; cooking; and discussing Torah. It's not unusual to find half a dozen people around our dining room table in a good natured but animated discussion! Of course there's food ... for body and soul! 8726471""",Contributor,4.7,United States,2006-04-01,2,10,http://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/q_92/v1/food_avatar/40913125/1MDfezlRwSZCgSsifT5J_GB%202007.jpg,6907

Day job in marketing, I like to cook whenever I can grab time. (Working on making that more rather than less as it has been for quite awhile.) Husband is a trained restaurateur and usually my toughest critic (grumble). We recently redid our kitchen and I'm itching to exercise all of the fun new toys, including my first ever new stovetop/oven. (GE Profile Dual Fuel convection bay-beee!) I enjoy both baking and cooking, and am constrained only by time, not patience. Er, patience that is except when it comes to pie crusts or anything that must be rolled. I simply despise rolling dough, won't do it, won't won't won't, so there! Generally, I look for recipes with fewer rather than more ingredients, but there's almost nothing I won't try (that doesn't need to be rolled!). Raised by a Southern mother, recipes from my youth appeal to me..but then so does Thai and Greek and (fill in cuisine here) as well. I'm also influenced by Jewish cooking (long story), so you can find a nice noodle kugel next to my black eyed peas prepared with ham. Enjoying this site and the energy of the community here immensely! I like reviewing and photographing your recipes, and am especially thrilled when I find an unreviewed or unphotographed gem that I can contribute to. I'm terribly new at this whole food photography thing, so most times my pictures fall in the ""better than nothing"" category, but I'm learning. Special thanks to my new friends in the food photography forum on the Zaar message board. --------------------------- Rating recipes, that can be a little tricky, can't it? I don't want to spend a lot of space on the topic, but maybe I rated your recipe and you'd like to know. Basically, I'm trying to use five stars for an exceptional ""best of breed"" kind of rating. Four stars is my ""this was really good and pretty darn easy, too"". Three stars, ""we didn't care for this but I can see how someone else might"". Anything lower than three stars, I haven't run into that yet. This is due in part, of course, to how wonderful Zaarites are...and due a bit to how I pick recipes to make. I look for well written instructions, a list of ingredients that my family already likes, and ingredients that are easily obtained without substitutions. Oh, and I follow instructions, that helps. Nothing is sillier than seeing a low rating on an otherwise fine recipe, where the reviewer then proceeds to go on about everything he or she changed, and then dismay at the final outcome...tres silly, don't you think? Zmail me for any reason, really.

My primary training is in lighting and wardrobe, and I can be found backstage at everything from rock concerts to opera/ballet/symphony/Broadway tour performances to hockey games to corporate meetings and Presidential appearances. In June of 2005, my Local elected me to serve as a delegate to our International convention in mid-July, which was held in Honolulu. In November of 2008, I was elected to my third three-year term as Recording Secretary of my union local. Currently, I am the news poster for www.megatechnews, a computer tech site affiliated with several other tech sites. My biggest passion is union activism. The more I get involved, the more I want to be involved. I also read like a fiend and enjoy ""discovering"" local or regional bands at local clubs. Recently, I started making jewelry again after a more than ten-year hiatus. It started as a project for Christmas presents, but doing it reminded me how much I enjoy it, so I may be resurrecting my business soon. I never duplicate a piece, because the entire point is that I do custom work, and will take orders to suit.

97932,258285,https://www.food.com/user/258285,CulinaryQueen,"UPDATED: 15 Aug 2007 Hi! Thanks for taking a peek at my page! I'm formally from East Norriton, PA, a suburb of Philadelphia. After 21 years of marriage, got divorced and met a Brit living in the U.S. He decided to come back to his homeland and I came over here about a year later. We were married in October 2005. Here I am down at Viking Bay which is only two miles from our house. My hubby grew up down here and I love living near the seaside. We adopted two rescue cats in May 2007 and now I have some company during the day! (Yeah sure, great company they are when they sleep all day!) Our two 'children'... Noddy (Lord of Nottingham) Alfie (Sir Alfred) I really have it made I think. I have a husband who can cook! I cook during the week and Peter cooks on the weekends. I have included some of his concoctions in my list of recipes. Me at the Scotland border, August 2005 I'm still unemployed which gives me plenty of time to experiment in the kitchen. I love to cook and try different things and 'Zaar has really helped in that aspect. I'd love to start my own business someday selling some of my homemade creations. I'm a Betty Boop freak and have loads of stuff that I've collected over the years including a porcelain doll of her in a wedding dress and I even have her tattooed on my ankle. ~~~~~~~ I enjoy doing cross stitch, cooking, baking and entertaining and hubby and I love our wines! Some of my pet peeves are bad hygiene, rudeness, bad manners, laziness and people who litter. My favorite cookbook is my Betty Crocker Cookybook. I've had a copy since I was about 12 and it was falling apart. My brother got me a new copy a couple of years ago from ebay and it was a FIRST EDITION and was in excellent condition. Now that I'm here in England, I find myself collecting more cookbooks. I'm going to need another room just for them if I don't cut down a bit!",Contributor,4.5,,2005-11-01,1,23,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pop.png,686

I love to cook, it's a great creative release for me. I usually use a recipe as a jumping off point, changing it as it works for us. When I post a recipe if I don't site a source you can assume it was one of my own creations which is likely to be a simple one dish kinda of thing. With a large family I'm all about easy and tasty. A recipe doesn't get posted unless the kids loved it. My star ratings 5 stars- Loved it! the family loved it and it will be added to my main cookbook 4 stars- Really liked it, may make a change or two and add it to my main cookbook 3 stars- Like it, may make it again, but it probably won't be a regular addition 2 stars- it was okay, but not likely to make it again with out many changes 1 star- not very good, would need to make several changes for our family's taste, won't make it again. I'm very honest in my reviews and whereas I don't like giving low reviews I will.

It is much more exciting than it sounds (well, except for the photocopying bit). I am English married to a Dutch bloke and we are both obsessed by food and travelling - hoorah! When I first joined Zaar my fave cookbooks were on the opposite ends of the spectrum: 'The Classic 1000 Quick and Easy Recipes' by Carloine Humphries and Gordon Ramsay's 'Just Deserts'. I hardly ever use the first book now because Zaar has replaced it. The second book can be extended to 'anything by Gordon Ramsay'. It is amazing that such a recognised chef can write recipes that always turn out well! What is particularly exciting about them is that when they aren't quite right I always know what I did wrong and can fix it the next time. When all said and done though, I really am a pudding cook. Main meals are great and I love them but I get much more pleasure from outrageous deserts. They have to be really outrageous though, with 6 eggs, a pint of cream and giant bars of chocolate. None of this delicate mousse type thing. I made a bavorois the other day and when all said and done it was just a posh mousse. I hope to post more recipes but finding the time is hard. When I review recipes I try to use the following ratings: 5 stars = great, I will make it again perhaps many times 4 stars = good, I will make it again but will probably adapt it 3 stars = ok, I may make it again but will definitely adapt it 2 stars = something went wrong 1 star = if I ever need to use this I won't post a review. I am too much of a scaredy custard I will always be honest and will try to give constructive feedback as well as say what I did differently. In cases where something went wrong I will try to explain why. Whatever rating I give though - thank you for posting.

A lot of my first recipes on here weren't vegan, but they're family favorites that can be easily adapted. I'm broadening my horizons and learning how to a) cook easy but tasty food, and b) be patient and cook more time consuming dishes. I'm passionate about mathematics, yoga, tasty food, dancing, the love of my life (also known as Tim), and our cat Moo. I work in the math department of a small liberal arts college for now. I hope to get my PhD in pure math (not sure exactly which field yet). I'll try anything once (as long as it doesn't involve eating anything from anything with orifices). My favorite comfort food cookbooks are How it All Vegan and Vegan Vittles, which adapt a lot of familiar dishes into animal-friendly alternatives. I can usually be found curled up working on a proof or a good book.

My goal is to organize all of my stray recipes to make sure they don't get lost, and also to remember which ones we love! I like a lot of variety, so I rarely cook the same thing week after week. The trouble is, as time goes by, it becomes difficult to remember all of the dishes that everyone loved and/or menus that were a hit when we had company. I'm hoping RecipeZaar will help on that front. I work part-time and have 2 young children, so mostly what I focus on these days is preparing simple, fresh, healthy meals that all of us will enjoy. Our kids are not coddled - they are expected to eat what they are served. However, I do try to have at least one item on the menu that I KNOW they'll like. They are very good eaters overall, but of course they have slightly different tastes, and my son is a ""separator,"" which makes soups and casseroles a challenge sometimes.

Cakes, cookies, wedding cakes (baking and decorating), pastries, candies, chocolates...you name it...I've probably made it. I planted an herb garden 2 seasons ago and really enjoyed it and having been doing so ever since. I had fresh herbs all summer long and an abundance to dry and ""put up"" for the winter. Nothing beats your own fresh rosemary, basil, thyme and savory, sage, mint, oregano. I have five huge rosemary bushes that are thriving outside, despite frigid weather (it's quite hardy!). Rosemary is probably my favorite herb. I love to infuse oils...the safe way. I infuse them right before I cook with them, either with garlic or herbs or both. I love making simple syrups (I always use the 2 to 1 ratio: 2 cups of sugar to 1 cup of water...it IS a syrup). I love it in hot tea and in a variety of drinks...even homemade ice creams. I've infused simple syrups with rosemary, lemon, apple mint, lime and lavender. All were fantastic with a cup of, for instance, blood orange/pomegranate green tea, or even basic teas or plain green teas. They do wonders for iced teas also. Try sweetening your lemonade with a basil simple syrup, it's great! I always have them on hand. They take up a huge amount of refrigerator space, but I cannot do without them. I am an amateur photographer and just got my new Canon XSi 450D Rebel and am having such a great time with it. I'm currently experimenting with macro photography with some great lens diopters.

I love to cook, bake, prepare, and eat food! Making new dishes is my entertainment. I thoroughly enjoy reading, mostly non-fiction with topics such as parenting, homeschooling, or health. Oh magazines are a favorite too. Exercise is important to me. I prefer walking outside, and doing pilates in my living room. I do some mild weight/strength building as well. For destressing and release I blog online and journal (actually with paper and pen). I also enjoy watching The Renegade Health Show on You Tube.

I am a (yet unpublished) fantasy writer that is lucky enough to have a husband who understands and accepts why I don't have a ""real"" job of my own. We have two kids (the purring kind) that are more than enough for the time being! I spend most of my non-kitchen time reading, playing video games of all kinds (yes, we girl gamers ARE out there, and we don't have to limit ourselves to casual games if we don't want to) and writing. My husband and I are working on an independent game design for a kid-friendly RPG that might go somewhere (well, we're hopeful anyway.) I tend to add things ""to taste"" and do not often measure ingredients for myself unless I am baking. Please take the listed amounts for my recipes as suggestions, not unbreakable rules. You should know what you like and there's no shame in following that. I don't expect everyone in the world to like the same level of salt, pepper and other seasonings that I do. Just go with your instincts. When in doubt, add to taste and stop when you're satisfied. You can always add more but you can't take it back out! I have been a type 1 diabetic since 1996 and I have been working hard to get myself back on track during the last few years, after spending several years in poor control. This also includes getting my weight down (ugh.) I am eager to try low-carb and low-fat options that still retain plenty of taste! Sugar itself is not the enemy but it does still add up to carbs, so I have to be cautious. My favorite cookbook would have to be Recipezaar! I don't often use formal cookbooks since I prefer to use my laptop to store everything safely. When I do, my favorite book would have to be my Taste of Home cookbook from 2003. It was my first cookbook and has some amazing recipes in it that I would love to make more often.",Contributor,4.7,,2005-07-01,0,3,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pie.png,5093

My boyfriend is an opera singer in Brooklyn, and I hope to join him up there, and learn a lot more about international cuisine than I do in Texas! I haven't used too many cookbooks since I became addicted to 'Zaar. I find way too many interesting things on here to try, and it's great to have the reviews already there, too, to give some other ideas of additions or changes. I have also become a big fan of making my own spice rubs and sauces. I generally pull out 10 or 12 things from my cabinet, start smelling them, and then dumping them in as I feel the urge. I don't really have a favorite dish to cook, though one of my new personal favorites is my Strawberry Pork Tenderloin. I just love when I get to be in the kitchen all day. I have an iPod shuffle that I clip to my apron, and I frequently sing and dance in the kitchen while I cook! There is a restaurant in Houston called Raffa's, and they are absolutely fab. They make a pork dish with fresh rosemary and a raspberry sauce that was largely inspiration for the Strawberry Pork Tenderloin I love to make. Other than that, I love Chinese take-out in any form, and just found tons of new restaurants in New York that I totally love. The more I read of people on this site, the bolder I get at trying my own things in the kitchen.

I'm an artist painting in oil on canvas, landscapes, seascapes, wildlife and florals. I paint all kinds of birds, animals, beautiful sunsets, sunrises, mountains, flowers, trees , beautiful nudes, street scenes and what ever else pleases me. I recently completed a series of paintings of old Spanish Catholic Churches, some of them dating back to 300 years. I have posted pictures a few of my works here on this site but only the ones that I have given to friends, I don’t publish pictures of sold paintings. My paintings are shipped to my Agent in the States for sales. I spend a lot of time traveling around the Philippines in search of beautiful scenes to paint . I love to paint “en plein air” ( out in the open air) and of course the scenery is beautiful as well as plentiful. The women of this tropical paradise are slim, trim with natural tans, are absolutely gorgeous and make great painting subjects. I love to cook American dishes for my Filipino friends who really do love them. I have learned to cook many delicious Filipino dishes mostly from my Filipino Mother-in Law who lives with us. I have taught her to prepare many American Dishes and she is an expert cook. Most American foods cannot be purchased here and some ingredients are impossible to find so my Sister ships to me what I cannot purchase here. My Filipino Mother-in- Law learned to make delicious patty sausage from scratch which is mostly used for sausage gravy which I love with biscuits. I make great light and fluffy biscuits from scratch, Bisquick is not available here.",Contributor,4.5,,2005-11-01,0,3,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pasta.png,6081

I'm a Christian, and have spent many years doing overseas mission work. I like to meet new people, and I love to make people feel at ease, comfortable, welcomed. I am outgoing and love to laugh! I enjoy learning new things and never finishing them, gardening, learning frugal tips, games, trying to live environmentally healthy, and researching anything. I'm very passionate about God, relevant Christianity, worship and music, and helping people understand missions and the dynamics of overseas adaptation. I like anything that is different and unique, sometimes playing the devil's advocate, but yet at times I find myself very conventional. I'm trying to learn how to cook....and thanks to the 'Zaar, I'm slowly learning! But I'm not very good yet, and not quite confident to cook for others(besides DH), but that may be related to my perfectionistic tendencies. Most of the stuff I know how to make I've learned to make as I've traveled and lived overseas. I didn't grow up learning how to cook(I had ZERO interest), and when you stay overseas, you have to learn to cook really fast. A couple of years ago, I found myself in a bind in Afghanistan with only basic ingredients, onions, flour, eggs, rice, lamb, chicken, spices, etc. I didn't know what to do with any of these ingredients and I was in charge of daily supper! The only thing I had ever made from scratch was cookies, and chocolate chips were definitely NOT available! :) So between once-a-week access to a sketchy satellite internet connection, a couple of cook books that were brought from the States, and lots of help from Afghan women, I began to build a repertoire of basic things, all made from scratch. When I returned from the States and started enjoying convenient food again, I couldn't forget the frustration I felt in Afghanistan of not being able to cook, and I really began to miss the hours in the kitchen I spent with my Afghan friends. I also knew I would be traveling a lot more in the future and so in order to avoid hunger in other countries, I took up an interest in cooking! Since Afghanistan, I've traveled to more places, and everywhere I go, I always hang out in the kitchen with the women....talking, laughing, learning, picking up any neat little tips, and adding more recipes to my ever-growing list! I'm still very much in a learner/observer mode. And I have A LOT to learn!",Contributor,4.7,,2006-09-01,8,3,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pop.png,1886

I am originally from Madrid, Spain but to look at me you would never know that. I do not look the part of the misconception that most people have of the stereotypical Spaniard. But most people don't understand that the original Spaniards were blonde and blue eyed. That is the category that I fit into. And of course that means Royalty and they don't call me a Princess for nothing! Just kidding, but I am so very proud of my heritage and love to joke about the royalty part since I have the coloring. I have a 16 year old son that is growing so fast I am not sure where the time went, but have loved most every single minute of it. He is the light of my life. I am so lucky to have such an incredible child. I am married for the second time to the most amazing man and we have been married for almost 9 years. Seems just like yesterday when we met. He makes me laugh all of the time and most importantly he LOVES my cooking. :-) But I believe that even if I didn't cook that would be allright with him. That I cook and cook well (at least in their opinion and that is all that matters) that is a bonus, he says. Living here in Texas has been quite an experience. It is just a bit hot for my tastes and I think also for my husbands. Our goal is to make it to Colorado one day. I want the snow. Not this darned heat we have so much of. We do have a good start on the idea of being in the cold, since we have the 3 Siberian Huskys. We adore them and want to go to Colorado or somewhere that it is cold, for them, my husband tells me. :) He says we have a good start on our sled team. What a comedian he is. Anyway, that is pretty much me in a nutshell.

102043,567251,https://www.food.com/user/567251,birdie 3 andrea,"i like cooking (simple things usually) and i think i have a pretty good taste for good food. i have some basic cooking tips/rules that i would like to share... 1) don't mess with the cook. lol this rule is very important. i mean if i am multi-tasking, the last thing i need is someone telling me how to do something. unless you are going to be the one cooking it...shut up please. cooks also do not need anyone bitching about all of the pots and pans we use either. so it is best to just kick everyone out of the kitchen. you should be able to enjoy cooking. 2) you have to start with a clean kitchen. clean the dishes. bleach the sink, disinfect the counter tops with soap and water. doing this makes the kitchen a more comfortable place. plus you aren't dreading any piled up dishes. 3) try to accumulate an assortment of spices over time or grow your own. growing your own is a lot cheaper. i paid about $2 for a basil plant, which grew about 4 times it's size in a matter of weeks and now i can use basil whenever i want or you can go to the store and pay about $4 for like 10 leaves that always seem to spoil within a few days. 4) when using fresh ingredients i have a few tips...especially when it comes to tomatoes. DON'T refridgerate your tomaters okay people! unless you like mushy tomatoes. the only exception is after you have already cut into it. onions don't belong in the fridge till you cut them either. also you can wrap a paper towel around cilantro and green onion or really any leafy vegetable that is damp. this will help it from spoiling so fast in the fridge. 5) always use vegetables and fruits that have a good flavor and texture. this goes for every ingredient in everything you cook. if you use an unripe tasting tomato sauce in your food...your food is going to have a sour taste. very important. do the taste test. 6) of course always wash your hands. especially after handling any raw meats. 7) watch your food cook. some people like to leave the kitchen and let stuff cook but unless it is a roast or carefully timed you run the risk of eating charcoal for dinner. my sisters favorite! lol 8) if you are really serious about cooking, don't have a tile countertop. grout is a bitch to clean. 9) don't get all crazy with the salt shaker and don't add any salt or pepper when you are angry. lol that comes from personal experience. lol you can always add salt and pepper after your dish is cooked. besides some people are sensitive to salt. nobody wants swollen ankles or super high blood pressure in the morning. lol 10) if you have time, clean the dishes or what you can, while you cook. it really makes things easier. i mean you are already in the cooking mood. just do it. who wants to do the dishes after they eat? lol 11) have your refridgerator and cupboard organized. that way you know what you have and can use it before it goes bad. it helps prevent overstocking too. my mother has like 10 bottles of red wine vinegarette in her cupboard that accumulated over time. i was like ""hey are you going to open a grocery store in here?"" lol 12) don't feel that you have to follow recipes exactly. if you know something will taste good added or subtracted to it, do it! experimenting makes cooking a lot easier and more exciting. sometimes i will just use the temperature and cooking times and completely ignore the rest of the recipe, doing my own thing. 13) have the garbage in an accessible location. 14) be a mad scientist in the kitchen. 15) oh and don't ever think you know it all or that you are the best because everyone has something different and great to share when it comes to cooking. you learn new things all the time. so be open to new ideas. just don't put up with any crap once you have started cooking whatever you have decided to cook. lol some really good things to try if you haven't already.

My passion for food started with my parents -- since food is such a focus of Filipino culture, anything was an excuse for cooking a large meal and inviting friends or family over. Cooking, on the other hand, is something I've only recently started enjoying -- I love having adventures in different parts of the world, and when I can't do that, I love having adventures in the kitchen. So I experiment a lot with new recipes and I'm always in search of the perfect version of something. I moved up to NYC a couple of years ago for work, and it's been heaven. The food in this city is fantastic, and I especially enjoy going out into Queens for ethnic dining. I work at a union full of burly guys who love to eat, so it's nice to be in like-minded company -- the granola vegans at my last non-profit job just didn't understand.

I live way out in the country so it's hard to find fresh herbs, and it's hard to make a quick trip to the grocery store to buy a missing ingrediant. We have to drive 30 minutes to get a gallon of milk! I enjoy healthy cooking. If you find a recipe of mine on here it's most definitly healthy. And I always tweak my recipes to become even more healthy for you. Like cake recipes I always replace the oil with natural applesauce which I think gives everything a better flavor. I'm not an expert on foods, however I would love to goto culinary school. I enjoy watching people cook on TV. I DO watch Emeril, and everything on food network. I love to watch the Cooking Episodes on the Health Channel. It really does give you some ideas for healthy meals. And in order to cook a recipe out of a Muscle and Fitness Magazine you got to be ready to tweak the ingrediants and get creative, because not all of them will turn out tasting the best. I also subscribe to Light n Tasty. I look forward to my new issue ever 2 months. I love that magazine. It's truely one of my favorites. It's alot better then Cooking Light if you ask me. School, my most favorite of all subjects is History. I LOVE IT! I always like to watch the educational channels as much as any ol' channel. I have a big interest in past wars, and politics. I'm not saying that I want to be president, I'm just saying I am very controversial whenever it comes to politics. And the 2000 election was so obvious, I knew George Bush would get it. Believe it or not, my mom asked ME who she should vote for. And I had already considered the pros and cons of George and Al, so I was 100% George Bush. Well, I'm going to go.

The science of food is amazing to me. I love to cook and love to eat even more! Currently, I do not work outside our home. We have a baby boy, who is 2 now. I love to see how he decides to eat his food and what he thinks after tasting it. For fun, I enjoy making new recipies and trying to come up with my own, which I call train wrecks. My favorite recipes are ones that do not have a long list of ingrdients and the ingredients it calls for are ones that I generally keep in the pantry. It makes me feel good when my husband tells me the meal I have prepared is a keeper and one to make again. I love him even more when he tells someone else about something that I make. The most feel good thing for me is when my mom asks for the recipe. My mother is the greatest domestic ""Chef de Cuisine"", or Head of the Kitchen, in my opinion.",Contributor,4.6,,2007-01-01,0,7,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pop.png,7055

102855,151325,https://www.food.com/user/151325,Mrs B,"I live with my husband and 2 cats in Worcester Park; a quiet typical 1930s suburb (which no one has ever heard of!) about 12 miles South West of London. I'm a fair weather gardener and as my husband is a vegetarian I grow a few easy vegetables, such as tomatoes and peppers, mainly in containers. My husband loves growing flowers, the brighter the better, and we have a pretty garden as a result. Our cats, Araminta and Purrl, like it too! I do a lot of cooking and try to keep our diet as healthy and varied as possible. Although I work full time, I use very little in the way of pre-prepared foods. This is partly because of the limited choice of vegetarian meals, which I think are overpriced anyway; but mainly because I like to know what goes in my food! I love using the Internet for all the great ideas it gives me. Last year I participated in the Zaar World Tour (under my previous public name Caroline Blakey), which was great. Mr B and I tried lots of new foods and discovered new favourite meals. Researching recipes for the Tour was really interesting, however as I didn't have time to try them all, some were posted untested. I'm still working my way very slowly through them. To make matters worse I keep seeing other recipes I want to save and have also participated in Zaar world Tour II. So many recipes, so little time to make them! My 'rules' for posting recipes are a) if I wouldn't make a particular recipe, I won't post it and b) if my husband wouldn't eat it, I won't post it. This means that all my recipes are vegetarian friendly. As you will see from the number of recipes saved in my cookbooks, I particularly enjoy making jams and chutneys; I'd say it was one of my favourite hobbies. We always have a good supply of home preserves; my friends and work colleagues are well supplied too. If we won the lottery (say £5m, as a good number) we'd like to give up work, move to the country and buy a place with a bit of land. In my dreams this would be a manor house or old vicarage, with a walled garden, an orchard where I could keep hens, a vegetable garden, etc, etc, etc! In my more realistic moments (the £1m win perhaps) I would like to run a B&B, perhaps offering Vegetarian taster weekends. Luckily it costs nothing to dream.......I’d also love more time to read, do embroidery, learn a language, see more of the countryside; and of course play on Zaar.",Contributor,4.5,"Worcester Park, Surrey",2004-07-01,0,7,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pop.png,910

102900,237783,https://www.food.com/user/237783,Mareesme,"I've loved Zaar for many years and the great recipes I've found here. Back when I was working and the kids were little I was an okay cook who excelled only at a few family recipes. I began ""surfing"" on Zaar and started making so many wonderful fast and easy recipes. As they got older and I had more time, I began making more adventurous meals. Zaar's fabulous cooks have helped me every step of the way. Thanks to the Zaar family of cooks and the enthusiasm for cooking I developed through them, I'm now considered a good cook and develop many of my own recipes. When the kids were grown and I was no longer working, what started as a place to find new recipes turned into a community made up of varied and interesting people. After years as a ""recipe surfer"", I became a premium member in 2005 not only to start organizing recipes but also to participate even more in discussions, forum activities and having fun with new friends. I am hoping you enjoy the recipes I have posted and welcome comments. I try to thank everyone who reviews one of them, but if I ""drop the ball"" or if you can't receive Zmail, please know how much I appreciate you taking the time to make one of my recipes. I'm a dinosaur when it comes to taking digital photos of my recipes and getting them into my computer. Because of that, cyberhugs go out to anyone who takes the time to take/post pictures of my dishes in Zaar! I've had vision problems plus a retina disease called retinopathy prematuria since birth, but never let it stop me until the last few years when I had to quit driving becauser of it. I moved from ""sweet home Chicago"" to rural San Diego County, CA, in 2004 when my husband of 35 years retired. Sadly, we are not near our children and beautiful grandchildren, who live in Florida, Minnesota and Arizona. Zaar has helped the transition from moving from the city to the country and becoming an empty nester confined to home a little more bearable. I still love to read my grisly crime novels, play on the computer, and play blackjack at local casinos (within reason, of course??) Even though my old friends tease that I'm a cross between a dirty old lady and a mother hen, Zaarites seem to bear with me. I think I love going to restaurants more because of reading the menus than eating the food.

103380,532179,https://www.food.com/user/532179,Dans La Lune,"I'm half French and half Italian, so that means I love food, I love wine, and I love food with wine! I'm passionate about my cultures and it reflects in my cooking style. I love dishes with complexity, richness, and unique character. I prefer cooking the old fashioned way, with less technology and more elbow grease, but with a new baby I have to sometimes bite the bullet and go with some shortcuts. But for the record, I NEVER use Cool Whip, Crisco, or margarine because I love ""whole"" foods that are in their unadulterated state... like butter, fresh whipped cream, etc. The real stuff ALWAYS tastes better. Not to mention those substitutes are pretty close to being plastic. As for my personal life, I have a 2 and a half year old girl named Sienna and an 8 month old girl named Mia. My husband and I love to enjoy a home cooked meal together and open a great bottle of red wine. My parents both are wonderful cooks. My father is a seasoning genius, and my mother makes everything taste delicious. They both instilled in me the love of food and the love of the art of food, and that every meal should be a celebrated occasion. The cake used as my ""icon"" picture... a beautiful mocha genoise, was made by my mother, and is probably at the top of my list for amazing desserts. I would probably eat that for breakfast, lunch, and dinner if it were available to me. Mmmmmm. I have traveled all over Europe and the United States, and also visited Morocco. Marrakesh is magical, France is inspiring, and I wish I could go back! I have truly become a Zaar addict and love searching out the highest rated recipes to share with family and friends. Doing this has saved me a ton of money at the grocery store because I can plan out my meals for the week and make one trip instead of shopping everyday. I love crockpot meals not just for the simplicity, but slow cooking in my opinion brings out remarkable flavor and tenderness and allows ingredients to meld just so. My rating system for recipes are as follows: 5 stars means it was FABULOUS and unique and I'll definitely be making it to impress my guests. 4 stars means it was great and I will be sure to make it again. 3 stars means it was good and served the purpose I needed but I may or may not make it again. 2 stars means I really didn't care for it and probably won't be making it again. It may not just be the taste, but other factors such as preparation involved and it's worth compared to the end result. 1 star means I really did not like this dish and will not make it again. Thanks for your interest and hope you enjoy my recipes! ******************** I first saw this on Karen from Colorado's page... I love it!... I didn't have potatoes, so I substituted rice. I didn't have paprika, so I used another spice. I didn't have tomato sauce, I used tomato paste; A whole can, not a half can - I don't believe in waste. A friend gave me the recipe; she said you couldn't beat it. There must be something wrong with her, I couldn't even eat it!",Contributor,4.6,,2007-07-01,0,12,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pasta.png,8796

I collect cookbooks, honestly don't have a favorite...I seldom use a recipe for anything other than an idea ( I have to now say that Zaar has changed that, I make it the first time by the recipe so I can fairly review it, then tweak or change the second time if I like it enough to make again and personalize it). I make everything from scratch and I guess if I have to pick a favorite, baking and canning would be my favorites. Zaar has given me the gift of meeting so many great people and 1 bestest friend..Free-Free and I met when we were paired for the Egg Cup Swap and we've attached to each other. Her spirit and determination sometimes leave me in awe. The miles don't matter, we have a blast! NanaLee is a great friend too...she is a very special lady with lots of heart and soul. I have 11 grandchildren, and just found out we have another one on the way.., 1 son, 3 daughters, DH flys Ultralights and supports my Zaar addiction happily, a couple of the swaps he's given a nudge on..(BarBQue for one). We work together, play together...makes life interesting. One daughter never caught the cooking bug but but my oldest granddaughter did..she's 10 and wants cooking ""tools"" for birthdays and Christmas...grammie is glad to oblige. My daughter in Phoenix has the cooking bug and is already doing a great job...she'll be cooking really tricky stuff before long.. It pleases me greatly that she is interested in something that I love so much. I have a cat named ""ChooChoo"", she's a russian blue that knows the purpose of the door knob...if she had fingers she'd be out the door all the time, she spends alot of time with her paws on the knob.

If you get me started talking about making beer I could, and do, go on for hours, completely ignoring the glazed eyes and bored countenance of my companions. I drink beer two or three times a week and usually have several styles on hand. I like to be able to not have to buy it. I like to BBQ, in the true sense of the word.

My wife and I are empty nesters, living on ten acres in the foothills. We?re animal lovers and have dogs, cats, goats and chickens. I love those fresh eggs. We compost, reuse, re-cycle, do whatever we can to lower our environmental footprint. I plant a big garden every year with tomatoes, squash, lots and all kinds of peppers, basil, cabbage, brussel sprouts, varieties of lettuce, berries, hops!, sometimes beans, sometimes potatoes, and whatever strikes my fancy at the time.

When I met my husband, 3o years ago, he was always going to flea markets and antique shows. So I figured, if we were going to hang out together, I needed to start collecting something. I now have a great collection of fruit & veggie shaped salt and pepper shakers, cookie jars, tea pots, dinnerware and serving dishes. Some of the pieces are older from the late 1800’s but most are vintage pieces from the 1930’s and 40’s. I grew up in Ohio. I lived in the San Francisco Bay Area and Northern California for many years. Currently, I am enjoying retirement with my husband in Southern Arizona. I now have the time to go through recipes and try different things. I love the RecipeZaar because every one gets to put in their two-cents. I get great suggestions from the reviews. Like a lot of cooks on this site, I rarely follow a recipe exactly but change it up the way I like it. I am going to try to post some of my own recipes. This may prove to be a bit difficult because I cook mostly by feel and instinct. I don’t measure things exactly. I’m one of those “a bit of this and a pinch of that” cooks. Also, I am looking forward to posting some of my 89 year old mother Isabel’s recipes. She is a very good, old fashioned cook and makes some dishes that I don’t see here on RecipeZaar.",Contributor,,,2008-02-01,3,0,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/sushi.png,8943

I’m absolutely passionate about food. My love of cooking / baking and all things food is only rivaled by my love for interior design and my in-depth interest in forensic science (what a combination). This explains my ""OFF BEAT"" humor! It wasn't always that way, I used to make a joke that my first marriage ended in divorce because of my then disdain for the kitchen... WOW HAVE I CHANGED! I’m really an artist at heart, everything I’ve ever been involved in or am doing currently revolves around the creative within me. For over 15 years I was in business for myself (The Salon Industry) where I met my now present husband. We currently own and operate our own Consulting / Marketing / Advertising firm, catering primarily to real estate agents and their properties. Yes, I have a techy background that spills into our business which is unique in that we handle all the details from start to finish. Business interests take us deep into the internet...a story on it's own! I collect chefs (yea,you read right), cookbooks and dishes. The dishes / table settings are in every color and style imaginable. I love to set theme tables that emphasizes the food (that’s the artist in me). I have an insatiable interest in cooking techniques and ingredients, especially the exotic. Our home is blessed with an array of cats, a dog, hamsters, exotic birds and tropical fish. There’s a whole lot of God, love and laughter being served along with the food here! I adore this site and I tip my hat to all the staff and ‘zaar contributors.

('Challenging' was the nicest word I could come up with to replace 'sucky'.) I have only been cooking for about 2 or 3 years and I have to be honest...if I didn't have Recipezaar recipes...we'd starve. I guess I just don't have that 'natural cooking compass' that most people have. I laugh when people say, ""Oh just improvise."" Huh? I need direction. And exactness! A pinch of what? Why not a quarter of a teaspoon? Or none! If it's only a pinch will we REALLY miss it if it's not there? Why use it? But just as I say this I will admit that I am getting much better. I'm not as afraid to try new things. It's just that my success percentages used to be FAR less common than my failure rate. My husband says I'm too hard on myself and he seems to enjoy every last morsel of everything I cook, so I guess that's what counts. He always manages to remind me however, of this GOD AWFUL concoction I made once in the 90's with my new TURBO COOKER. I'm surprised he still married me after that. We have a cat named Kitt E. and she rules our home. If I were a cat I would want to live at our house. I'd have it made. I'm a Food Network Addict. I can't get enough. I have become very proficient in altering recipes from ""high in fat & calories"" to ""low in fat & calories"". I'm down 17 and a half pounds and I'm very proud of that! (UPDATE: 27 pounds!) And now that I found this site, I've noticed I am ALWAYS here. It's such a welcoming community. I have printed a MILLION recipes in the last couple of weeks. I'm gonna need a new ink cartridge, a ream of paper, and a TREADMILL.

These are dishes that are good but they are missing something or they don't live up to my expectations.

Many of my cooking skills come from my mother, who managed an upscale restaurant for a number of years. She also learned from her grandmothers, who were well know n for being fantastic chefs. My favorite recipe book is her collection in an accordion file that she has gathered since childhood. As you can tell, I LOVE Spongebob. It is the best way to wind down from a long day- you don't have to think! :) I am an avid reader, and must always have a book with me.

When I do go out to a restaurant I find myself thinking that I could make the same thing at home much better thanks to Zaar chef's!!! I think it's nice to share so I am adding some of my favorite recipes here and there and I thank all of you in advance who try them. I absolutely love to read mystery and suspense novels and if a little romance is mixed in it doesn't hurt ;) either. I also love to sew - no clothes though. My biggest project that I currently want to tackle is making a sweater blanket for my bed. I've been collecting wool sweaters for a couple years now and just have to make myself cut out the pieces and put them together.

I have been cooking since i was about 6 years old, i remember climbing up on the counter tops and rummaging through the pantry for anything that would mix. i don't know if you would call that cooking per say but i was experimenting in the very least. I really learned how to cook in about the 5th grade when my parents got a divorce and my mom would get home late from work, so i would make dinner and have it ready for her when she got home. My mom taught me the basics and all the family recipes, she is an awesome cook and mother. I really like to experiment with recipes and try new foods. I love to share my recipes with my friends and co-workers, we trade recipes at work all the time, and sometimes bring in food to share. Everyone at my work says i should go to culinary school, and if i could afford it would go. My husband always says how lucky of a guy he is that his wife can cook, since so many young girls have no interest and their mothers never taught them.

I am living with my sister for the time being, and am loving every minute of it. We share cooking duties as both of us are now working. I love coming here to find new quick easy-fix meals that I can cook for my sister so she does not have to worry about it after a hard day at the office. She is an inside sales rep and I work as a project coordinator with a small construction firm. My husband is still working in Texas for now, but that will soon change and he will be joining me here in Alabama. I just want everyone who reads my profile knows how much I love this site. You guys are wonderful. I've always loved the Betty Crocker Cookbooks and Southern Living Cookbooks; their annual ones. Of course I love looking at any and all recipes for some reason even though I'm not a cook. I'm for anything that is quick and easy - in and out of the kitchen in record time. I especially love crockpot/slow cooker recipes. I spend most of my time reading, but I do enjoy counted cross-stitch also. I love playing around in the water (not a very good swimmer). My husband and I had Mason, an 8 year old Cocker Spaniel (who recently passed away - he will be missed very much as he was a huge part of our family), Pretty Boy, a 5 year old Cockatiel, and a recent addition to our growing menagerie, Pat, a blue conure whose vocabulary includes: ""Hello"", ""Luv U"", ""What you doin"", ""All Right"", and ""Pretty Pat"". We are both into collecting: He loves collecting Dragons & Wolves, and I'm into Tweety Memorabilia and Bells. My dream is to travel through Alaska one of these days.

112579,317719,https://www.food.com/user/317719,Trixie735,"Hi. I started on Recipeezaar about two years ago and use it exclusively for new recipes. I love the variety and am thankful for the reviews and tips. I started cooking about 20 years ago (pretty late in life though). My mom did it all -- but with 8 kids pulling on her apron at all times, she never had time to really teach us (the girls) how to cook -- certainly did watch but wasn't what I would consider a cook til I got married (26 then). What a disaster that was! A dear friend helped me plan my first dinner party. She didn't help me cook -- but gave me recipes, tips, etc. It was 3 couples plus my now EX husband and me -- I went all out -- decorated, lighting was perfect, and the food smelled good. As the dinner party was getting seated and I was about to make a toast, our doorbell rang and Pizza Hut showed up -- my now EX husband and his buddy decided that I wouldn't be able to cook anything worth eating and they wanted a back-up plan! Now you can better appreciate the emphasis I've placed on EX husband. Anyway, as a single gal again, I started cooking -- anything and everything I could --through good friends and many cookbooks, I became quite a good cook. (My present and WONDERFUL husband of 14 yrs is living proof of that fact -- his waistline has expanded in these last 14 years.) My passion is to make people happy and one of the ways I do so is through cooking. I uploaded my first recipe post yesterday evening -- was always too scared -- but my husband encouraged me to go for it. Anyway, if y'all find it and give it a try, your feedback is most appreciated -- this forum is full of SUPERIOR chefs, cooks, and great people. Look forward to continuing Recipezaar as my main source for furthering my cooking skills. Take care!!

Actually I love just about everything Disney. One of the things I miss most from living in Florida was getting to go to Walt Disney World anytime I wanted to. It really is one of the happiest places on earth. I love to cook and am always trying a new recipe. I also like to garden, but find it quite a challenge here in Wyoming with our long winters and dry windy short summers. I like to experiment with herbs and spices. During the summer of 2006 I was diagnosed with PCOS and as such realized that the excess weight I was carrying was quite literally killing me. I found SparkPeople.com and was able to lose over 75 pounds now with not too much more to go.

I have enjoyed recipezaar for 5 years now, and plan to put more of my own recipes up at some point.

I was a stay-at-home mom for several years until I got divorced. My kids and I have been a family of 3 ever since. We're your basic family. We like to play video games (PS2, Gamecube, wii, Nintendo DS) and watch The Simpsons (being that's all we have due to no cable tv). My favorite thing to do is to bbq and drink a few beers with family and friends. Our family does like to cook. I'm not a fancy, exquisite cook, but I do have a few favorites that my family loves. My ex-husband used to love my chili-cheese hot dogs and my kids love my lasagna. But, like your average kid, they love Hamburger Helper. I always brag that my son makes a better pecan pie than I do. We use the recipe that comes on the Karo syrup bottle.

117381,38717,https://www.food.com/user/38717,Judy-Jude,"Recipezaar Editor: Thank you for visiting Judy-Jude's page. Sadly, Judy-Jude passed away on January 8, 2009. She had many friends here, and she will be missed. I have been a member on Zaar since 2002 and I am addicted to Zaar. I want you all to never give up hope fighting cancer and giving your loved ones the hope to keep going. I am a cancer survivor, since February of 2004, when I had surgery for lung cancer. I received so much support from all the members on Zaar and I am so grateful to everybody that encouraged me to get stronger each day. In January (2006) my dear husband and best friend died, once again the Zaar family was there for me. In May of (2007) I was admitted to the emergency room for a problem with my intestines, at that time I learned that my lung cancer had returned but in an area, that is not operable in my thorax area. I went through my reconnective surgery on my intestines first and no cancer was found there. In August, I was strong enough to begin radiation treatments and I thankful so write that, to date, the radiation is working on reducing the tumors. I am now addressing an issue with the return of cancer in my upper lobe of my left lung. I am hopeful that I can start a new chemotherapy regimen to fight this, once again. May 28th 2008, When my ability to communicate via E-mail was difficult, I knew I had some serious issues going on. I was elated when I had my CAT Scan in April because it indicated that the Chemo Tarceva pill and that I take each day, appears to be working, the new spots on my left lung and not gotten larger. Dr. Sims, who put me on Tarceva, was very pleased. A follow-up visit a couple days later, indicated that the tumors that were treated, continued to shrink, Dr. Nixon was so pleased. Both of my specialists felt that I was just weak and once I got some weight back on, this would go away. It got worse, I had such little energy, it was difficult to put 8 hours of work each day. I could barely get my words out, my dear friend Louise took me to the ER that Exeter Hospital, the staff was wonderful, I think they felt that I was having a stroke. The ER doctor was wonderful and suspected the cancer had spread or I had pressure on the brain, causing this. The MRI indicated the mass in the head, which was a large tumor putting pressure, therefore, that acted similiar to a stroke. Luckily I caught it before it hit my whole right side. On June 9th I had my operation, appears to be a success and the tumor had not attached to the brain tissue. I came home on June 13th, Louise my dear friend stayed with me at night and we had some fun!! On Monday afternoon, when she came to stay, I sent her on way because I can stay alone at night now. I am bouncing back!!! go for radiation again, but I know the Staff and Mark Wentworth Hospital from my previous radiation treatment and I adore Dr. Nixon. Time to get well and continue the fight!! Speach stutter is almost gone and the ability to type is back!!!! I have a wonderful support system of friends and co-workers and of course Zaar. Great site.....great Zaar family to belong to. I can't ever thank each and every member enough for all their on-going prayers and support. I love to cook and share recipes. My favorite cookbook is ""Italian Family Cooking"" by Anne Casale. I enjoy gardening and my hobby is stained glass projects. Enjoy all the time I can with dear friends.",Contributor,4.6,United States,2002-04-01,1,7,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pop.png,4504

I love to cook when I have time, and am constantly looking for new and fun dishes to try out. My signature dishes are a posole dish, chili, and also my hub's favorite, lasagna. Often, I will wing it in the kitchen, either loosely following recipes or not using one at all. I have just started to do Once A Month Cooking. For me, this system is a lifesaver. Working full time and commuting over 2 hours a day leaves me with little time or energy to make weeknight meals. I love the convenience of having delicious, homemade frozen meals already prepared and ready to heat up. This year has been a rough one on a personal level. In January we lost our 5 year old Rottie very suddenly to a seizure of some sort. In June, my husband was in a coma as a result of a drug interaction. In September, we lost our second dog to Histiocystic Sarcoma, which we did not know he had until right before we had to put him down. For me, cooking can become therapeutic, allowing me to forget about my worries and hurts, and letting me create something sarisfying. I work for a financial company.

One of my biggest pet peeves is when people give stars to a recipe they haven't tried. My star rating is as follows: 5 Stars= This has either gotten rave reviews from my family or the type of recipe I can't stop eating or that we fix on a regular basis and REALLY enjoy. 4 Stars= This is pretty good, I'll fix it again but I can easily control my portions. 3 Stars= Ok I can eat this and may try again. Maybe I thought it was just OK, but someone in my family raved about it. 2 Stars= Just OK, probably won't fix again. Still edible, just not truely enjoyed. 1 Star= Had to throw it out.

There were nights when we would have just corn for dinner and think nothing of it! Nowadays, however, my taste buds have definitely changed. Living in beautiful, sunny San Diego, my weekend would not be complete without a trip to the farmer's market for fresh veggies, herbs, and flowers. I love to travel and that has really influenced my bravery to try new things (including some Asian ""dilicacies"" that I will refrain from in the future!) and my cooking style. Rarely do I make repeat recipes b/c I get so excited about trying new ones, much to the annoyance of my hubby... :) When I'm not found in the kitchen, I'm either at school teaching 5th grade (greatest passion above anything!) or enjoying the outdoors. I love beach and trail running and yoga. The boy loves surfing and as terrified as I am of jelly fish and freezing water, I think I'm going to try my hand at it again here sometime soon. :) One of life's greatest joys for me is watching the sunset. I walk down at least four times a week to watch the show. There's usually quite the group that forms in the area I go to, and it's absolute tranquility when the sun slowly dips beneath the ocean, as we all watch in silence. If it's more beautiful than normal, there's usually even a round of applause afterwards. Yea, nature. :)",Contributor,,,2006-12-01,0,2,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/drink.png,5735

I have been in the kitchen with my mom since I was 12, learning from her. . I now had to learn how to cook & bake all over again. I had to learn how to bake GF, cook GF,...it was a huge challenge. Most of what I had learned for the last 40 years had to be adjusted. I gave up for a period of time, very discouraged. Now, I look forward to time for my baking... I have learned how to adjust and bake, making most recipes GF. We have raspberries, Rhubarb, Blueberries, and Marionberries out in our garden, so I have plenty of fruit to keep me busy in the spring and summer. I also enjoy making fresh jam for my family and being able to have it year round in the freezer. I live in the Pacific Northwest. I have the mountains, the beach, and high desert all within two hour drive. Time taken for trips to the Pacific Coastline renews me when I am worn out and stressed.? What I enjoy to do for fun is being outdoors, riding our motorcycle, camping and cruising when we can. I love the wildlife, a short hike in the woods is wonderful. I love to do hand stitching. I am recently working on Angel Of Hope. It's that time of year. Hummm....Pet Peeve, oh I have one. crazy as this is..... I hate cleaning up the counter and floured area after rolling out pie crust.

I'm originally from Michigan, so life here is very different than what I'm use to. My mom was a stay at home mom who did all those ""wife/mother chores"". Now that I'm out on my own, I do miss her very much! I joined this site to try out new recipes and to find recipes that dealt with stove top only because they do not have ovens here in Korea. That is a new one for me because what I did learn from my mom was all baked dishes. So far all the recipes that I've tried from this site have been wonderful! I'm very grateful that I found this site and that I'm able to satisfy my husband's tastes. I get lonely here sometimes and cooking seems to take my mind off of that. I never understood the joys of cooking until I got married. I have few hobbies, but the major one is gardening. I love to garden!! Mostly vegetables, but I do dabble in some flowers. Again, being in Korea does put a damper on that hobby so that's why I tend to get bored. I love to get my hands dirty! I'm a recent graduate of Michigan State University w/ a BA in Environmental Soil Science and has you can probably tell by reading this blurb...it hasn't done a damn thing for me yet!

I spend my time trying to honor the Lord, loving my wonderful husband, working with and thinking about children with Autism, avoiding homework and housework, researching home decor'/ cleaning supplies, and every so often trying out a new recipe on unsuspecting friends and family. My household consists of myself, my husband, a docile daschund named Buddy, and a hyperactive chiweenie named Samson. We are in the process of buying and fixing up our first home, and along with that- my very first kitchen! My maiden name is Cook, and I feel a certain longing to live up to the title. My mother was a completley self-taught southern cook, and I learned most of what I know from hanging on her apron strings in the kitchen. I took a home ec cooking coarse in high school, which was taught by the traditional I'm-not-married-but when-I-do-get-married-it-will-be-my-whole-life-cooking-and-cleaning teacher. She regarded Betty Crocker's cookbook as a second to the Bible, and made sure we students did too. After that class my cooking passion went on hold until I got married and finished undergrad. Now, with a husband to feed, and in-laws to impress, I find myself watching food network, buying specialty kitchen tools, and searching websites for that perfect recipe, and that is how I found Recipezaar.",Contributor,5.0,,2009-04-01,0,1,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pasta.png,9738

That was when I decided to purchase a Premium Membership. I live in a small but quickly-growing town called Forney, located just east of Dallas, TX. I work as a teacher's aide in Special Education, with children who have severe and profound developmental delays. It's the best job I've ever had. I'm supposed to be helping them learn, but these children have taught me more than any teacher or college professor I've ever had. My husband is Jason, and our 10-year-old son is Charlie. They are both lactose-intolerant, so we all avoid dairy, for the most part. Jason is 3 years post-op gastric bypass, and he follows the South Beach Diet. Charlie has a sensitive system, and must avoid high-fiber foods and sugar alcohols. He also has an enormous sweet tooth. So lately, I cook supper for Charlie and me, and Jason has a sandwich wrap of some kind. That's not good. So I have returned to Recipezaar to find recipes that will work for everyone's dietary needs.

My favorite things to do for fun are go out for a jog, spend time outdoors with family, have dinners on the backyard patio, and just spend time with my friends. Now we are remodeling our basement, and my room will be down there! It will be nice to just get away sometimes. We currently have no pets, but the critters in the woods sure call our yard their home! A few days ago, we found a couple of snakes in our garage. I freaked out! I am so petrified of snakes, spiders, and any bug that looks sort of creepy! Well, I hope you enjoy my recipes!

He isn't officially vegan, but since he loves my cooking, he has vegan days a few times a week. I love to bake all sorts of different treats and I tend to make up recipes as I go...I usually forget to write down the ingredients so we never have the same thing twice - but I find some recipes are more interesting that way. My favourite cook book right now is called ""Foods that Don't Bite Back"" which was a birthday presesnt from a good friend. It has a lot of simple but amazing recipes that are quick to prepare.

My husband is a restaurant manager, so after working with food all day, it is tricky to keep him interested in eating while he's at home. He also brings extra things home from work, (and usually in large quantities) so I am always trying to find ways to use up various ingredients in non-traditional and interesting ways. I like to shop at the warehouse club, which means buying things in larger quantities for freezing, so any recipes that freeze well are at the top of my list. I love to find new or unknown recipes and review them, rather than using the recipes that have hundreds of reviews already!",Contributor,5.0,,2005-08-01,0,0,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pie.png,9422

I discovered this site when I was looking for something new and different to cook. I like anything thats quick and easy but tasty. With a new baby I really don't have a lot of time to spend in the kitchen but got tired of eating hamburger helper lol. I have gotten a lot of wonderful recipes from this site I just feel bad that I don't have many of my own to add. For fun I used to read but can't seem the time to do much of that latley but when I do I like Patricia Cornwell. I like taking my kids to the park or beach when its nice out. I love playing with my son and watching him grow everyday its something new with him. Me and my husband like going to the movies and concerts when we can actually find someone to babysit. Well thats about it for now.,Contributor,4.6,,2008-12-01,0,0,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/drink.png,2390

My DH has been a wonderful taste tester for me. Some of the recipes he has enjoyed, and some he hopes I never make again.

My mom is from the Deep South, and brought me up to use the Louisiana ""Holy Trinity"" of bell peppers, onions and celery in just about everything ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_trinity_(cuisine) ). I have a very adventurous palate and one of my favourite kinds of food is Middle Eastern. For two years, I kept to a vegetarian diet--I don't anymore, but I still don't eat a great deal of meat, especially if it isn't fish or poultry.

I love to cook and recently lost 25 pounds by eating my own cooking instead of eating out so often (as well as exercising). My best cooking buddies are two Siamese babies named Watson (male seal point) and Cricket (female chocolate point). I have an advanced degree in science and if you too are a scientist you'll understand the cat's names from famous molecular geneticists. For fun I am an accomplished recurve archer and I've trained at the Olympic Training Center. I was trying for the 2004 olympic team but life got in the way. I fly fish, shoot skeet and pistol shoot. I purchased a Sony Clie PDA and PDA Cookbook (www.wakefieldsoft.com) and I now have all my recipes in my pocketbook when I go to the store. No more leaving without all the necessary ingredients. It has made cooking much easier and more fun. All my recipes are also on my computer - if you are into technology I highly recommend owning a handheld and PDA Cookbook.",Contributor,,"Loveland, Ohio",2002-06-01,0,0,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/fruit-kebab.png,6393

I'm sixteen years old and love to cook. Seriosuly , I always bug my mum when she's coming home - "" Can I boil an egg ? Do you want me to put on the pasta ? "" etc - and I have little tradition where I cook a complete dinner once a fortnight. Thats' generally what I review recipes for as I don't get a chance to cook the rest of the time :( Since I live in Hong Kong, I don't have access to a lot of the stuff most Recipezaar-ers in the US do , so I spend a lot of time filtering out refrigerated buttermilk biscuits , frozen pie shells, pastry flour and all those instant mixes >< Its' not just that I live in Hong Kong though , my pantry (physically impossible in a two-bedroom flat, but there in mind and spirit) is small. What I always have in the kitchen : plain flour, self-raising flour, sugar, cocoa, pasta, canned beans, canned tomatoes, fresh tomatoes, garlic, onion, some kind of cheese, low-fat yogurt, low-fat milk, water, frozen berries, muesli. I guess a love of food is born in as I'm half-Italian. I go to Sicily every summer and its so different from here - there is this ...respect for food. I LOVE IT The other half of me has an ex-baking grandma ( she stopped after she had no-one to fatten up ) and I think I got a bit of that too , I absolutely ADORE making cakes, cookies,muffins but I hate having them around the house . I mulled over the idea of selling my baked stuff but in the end decided I'd probably get arrested for hawking and no-one would know what I was doing anyway. My rating system - ***** Perfect. this is for whatever the recipe claims to be, i.e. if a recipe a simple,quick, economic stew I won't give it *** for not being finicky or delicate. These are often foolproof, too :) **** Almost perfect, but there was something missing. *** All right . Not a bad recipe, but I didn't like it. ** Not enjoyable, but with some spark or facet with merit. * Godawful.

He is my best friend and my biggest cheerleader in all that I seek to do. We have been married 24 years this Feb of 2005.And together we have 4 boy's aged from 21-9. We live on the central coast from originally the central valley of california. Although it is beautiful here it is expensive and we miss the special friends we left. We now know that the beauty of your surroundings can only take you so far,eventually life finds you no matter the paradise you live. The thing that brings me joy is to see the expressions on peoples faces when they are enjoying what was prepared. Especially when I bring some goodies to a group function and people are not expecting it. People really do appreciate when we give of ourselves in cooking. I have learned a lot while cooking for various functions and groups at my church as well as for friends parties in the past. One is not to PANIC when things do't go as planned. Iv'e learned the art of improvision with grace. Most importantly, as long as I am cooking with love and putting my heart into it the end result will come together in spite of all the stress I expend. Better to ride the wave and enjoy the scenery. My passion? To make people feel at home and welcome no matter where we are together,the best way to do that is with food and the personal touches that come with hospitality and making people you serve feel special. Beyond that I like to write, usually as things come to me. I am not a very organized writer,although I am trying to dicipline myself to be, yet not loose the freedom of my writing. My pet peeve.. I don't have my husbands metabolism, he can eat and not gain weight...and people who think they are better than someone else and show it with arrogance and rudness, people in all social classes and races fall into that trap.",Contributor,,"Clovis, CA",2001-06-01,0,0,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pop.png,5485

However, this has drastically changed my cooking and eating habits. Dinner is no problem, but breakfast and lunch are a bit challenging without wheat at first, lol! I have always loved asian food, and can still eat that, since it does not use cheese, milk or wheat as a rule. Authentic Mexican, african and caribbean food also work for me, and are delicious.

I absolutely love cooking and find making a big meal incredibly relaxing. I love to prepare food for others and entertain. I am fortunate to have many friends who are willing to try all my culinary experiments. As an only child I have been blessed with the opportunity to experience many adult flavors and tastes at a young age. This has instilled in me my love for gourmet foods, which I consider one of life’s greatest luxuries. My favorite food as a child was escargot (and still reigns number one on my favorite food list today) which leads me to my conclusion that anyone can really like anything, you just have to try it. Because of this I try everything once. The world of flavor is so vast that I don’t want to miss out on anything that I may truly like, but was too ""chicken"" to try. (and yes, I have tried chicken feet) Although I do love fine foods I am not a “food snob” a nice squished grilled cheese made with Wonder Bread and Cheeze Whiz is on my top ten favorite foods list too. As far as food types are concerned I really do like just about everything, especially ethnic food. I am enjoying alot of Thai and Arabic food right now and also favour Greek and South American cuisine also. Yumm!

I like exposing kids to different ways of making things and getting them to actually try something new. At our house you can not say ""I don't like..."" until you have tried it. You would be suprised the things kids have never tried but just think they don't like. It is a wonderful feeling to have another parent come up and say how did you get my kid to eat that?? Next question is for the recipe, of which I will gladly share. I am very blessed by all things good in my life. I LOVE to feed people and enjoy my time searching the most interesting recipes submitted by those who like me, have a passion for cooking! Thanks Zaar!",Contributor,,,2006-02-01,0,0,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/burger.png,9739

145450,543183,https://www.food.com/user/543183,Converting to vegan,"I'm Scottish and have lived in North America for 17 years (8 in Canada, 9 in the USA). I have been 100% vegetarian for the past 6 years, and only ate fish once or twice a month before that for another 8 years or so. Now I'm eating vegan about 80% of the time and always looking to try out new and tasty recipes. I live in Ohio now, and although it is beautiful, one of my pet peeves is the absolutely atrocious food available in restaurants and more specifically the lack of veggie options. When dining with friends I get so mad (inside of course) when they say: ""oh look there's a couple of salads you can have"". I don't go out to eat salads; I want a meal! Well, this is one of the main reasons I cook so much and enjoy cooking so much too. It is extremely gratifying when I invite people to the house and they enjoy what I make by really diving into the food. I also enjoy gardening, so in the summer I cook and can like crazy preserving tomatoes, cucumbers, tomatillos, peppers, zucchini and lots of herbs. I am a professor at a local university and love my job. I feel that I get paid to do a hobby. However, I am ultra busy so I like to make things that are quick and simple or things that I can freeze and reheat at a later date.",Contributor,4.5,,2007-07-01,0,0,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/taco.png,4226

145504,1185662,https://www.food.com/user/1185662,yellow_apple30,"I love to cook. My idea of the perfect gift is a cooking gadget, which amuses my family to no end. I was given the choice of a lovely sapphire ring as an anniversary gift or a set of titanium cookware, and it was really no shock to anyone that I chose the latter. I am particularly interested in heart-healthy cooking and love to find recipes that are both healthy and jam-packed with flavor. However, that said, I do not try to make healthy desserts. I’d rather have a smaller portion of a decadent, naughty sweet than an entire tray of something that tastes wholesome. I am a Marine wife, happily married to the kindest, sweetest military man there is. I am a stay-at-home mom to a daughter and two dogs, a Pug and a Dachshund. I am a massage therapist with the goal of going to nursing school, hopefully in the next couple years. I did not grow up in a family where cooking was an integral part of our lives. My bag of cooking tricks has next to nothing learned from my mother or grandmother, so I am very much starting from scratch. At first, I needed to learn to cook the basics so I could provide home cooked meals for my husband and daughter. However, in a surprise twist, I actually enjoy cooking. I like the entire process. I like to make as much as I can homemade, and I enjoy the challenge of cooking dishes that don’t utilize premade, store-bought shortcuts. Unfortunately, I don’t have any friends who enjoy cooking. This is a real bummer for me since there’s almost nothing I enjoy more than sharing my recipes and having others share theirs. Since we are a military family, there is always the hope that when we relocate I may meet other home cooks who love to share their secrets. Until then, I’ll have to get my food fellowship time in online. When not in the kitchen, my number one favorite thing to do is read. I have a degree in English Literature that enriches my life to no end but has not turned into something I’d like to do as a career. I often read a novel while cooking, which explains why the books I pass onto friends often have olive oil or tomato stains on some of the pages. I also enjoy writing, though I don’t seem to have the attention span to finish much of anything. I am currently writing product reviews for a green living blog. I am not a social butterfly, a personality trait I have tried to change but to no success. Give me time alone with a good book or a page to write, or give me quality time with my family or one of my three close friends (all of whom are several hundred miles away from me), and I am completely content. The only part of socializing I enjoy is being able to cook or bake for others.

145928,241872,https://www.food.com/user/241872,Chef Pat3,"Hi. I live in SW Ontario on a mixed farm with my husband and 4 growing boys. We grow a variety of edible beans, corn, wheat, oats, and hay. We raise sheep and cattle, a few free-range laying chickens, a few meat chickens, rabbits, cats and a dog. I work with my husband on the farm and our drainage business sometimes, volunteer at the boys school, church, and 4H. I also just started a part time business with a friend of mine - housecleaning. I love to vegetable garden. Every year I buy too many seeds, grow too many plants and end up with a whole lot of weeds. Last year I made 2 raised beds, and this year I plotted out several small ""beds"". We will see how that goes. When the kids get off the bus during pea season they will head out to the garden for their snack. That is what makes gardening so worth it to me. My pet peeve: Oooh this one still gets me. Do you work? HMMMMMMM....yes, I work. I put on a full course meal almost every evening, volunteer more than most, had 4 boys in less than 4 years, do chores, etc. My friends who work at a paying job would often say to me ""I wish I were like you and be able to do whatever I want whenever I want"" That makes me just growl.",Contributor,3.8,,2005-09-01,0,0,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/burger.png,7317

Other times they took a mere 5-10 minutes and threw together ingredients like a spackle painting. Once put all together, your taste buds danced with joy at each bite you took.

I do my best most days to make my mark on the universal energy be a positive one. More often than not, I believe I succeed. I love my cats - all four of the persnickety little balls of fur. I love to cook! But I really detest baking ... I tend to cook by 'smell' rather than taste and it feels almost like 'painting' or 'composing' with flavors, especially herbs and spices. Luckily, both my DH and 10 yr old DD love flavors! Not many moms can say that sushi has been their child's favorite food since age 8! From complex layers like curries to clean & simple like citrus thyme marinades, we look forward to playing with them all. Being a busy mom, I appreciate the fast things. I love my crockery cooker, microwave pasta/rice cooker, and quick bread/biscuit recipes! I may detest baking in general, but nothing rounds out a frazzled evening 1-skillet meal like a side of fast, fresh biscuits or rolls or thick slabs of beer bread! When I'm not cooking, reading, antiquing, volunteering, teaching, or camping & traveling, I love trying different beers and wines. I am also always researching and learning about something that's caught my attention.

Hehee. My husband and I are both vegans (I've been a vegetarian since January 2004, he has been since January 2005, and we went vegan in January 2006 -- we're funny like that). We love going out to eat (especially Ethiopian and veggie sushi) and trying new recipes at home. We love it when we accidentally stumble upon a new recipe by accident when trying to do something else entirely, haha. I also love animals, photography, painting, exercise (mainly Tae Bo, hiking, and bouldering), museums, art galleries, old movies, making crafts with my hubby, reading, volunteering at our local animal shelter, and learning how to make a website for our natural soap-making business! Our sweet little 18-month old cat Jake passed away because of FIV on July 31, 2006 and we all miss him terribly.

I work full time, at a community services board, in the Human Resources depeartment, so I like to find recipes that I can make in less than a half hour, since there is not much time once I get home. I have a 3 year old little boy, Aidan, who definitely keeps me busy. He is so independent and definitely knows what he wants/does not want! It is great watching him change each day a little more. He can be a picky eater, so I try to find things to make where I can take parts out of it that he will eat as well. I love warm weather - spring and summer !

My kids love to spend time with either Mom or Dad in the kitchen. We moved to a new home a few months ago, with a larger kitchen that has a nice peninsula counter that lets us work together putting food together as a team. We are having lots of fun. My kids who have been picky eaters at times love to try the recipes I find here on Zaar. It is fun to hear them ask, is this a Zaar recipe? OK, then I'll try it. We have not been disappointed in my choosing of recipes yet.

155429,534058,https://www.food.com/user/534058,Spice Princess,"Updated June 2011: I'm 32 and married to the absolute love of my life.  We just bought our first real home together and we're settling in, trying to get things just the way we want them.  Hopefully before too long we will be starting a family!  After DH finishes college, that is... I'm a vegetarian, but DH loves meat, although he likes a lot of vegetarian food, too.  I like to find meat recipes that I can modify to be veg so we can cook it together side by side -- in two separate pots.  Now that we have a real house, DH is obsessed with grilling everything possible, so I'm expecting that to rub off on me as well.  I'm excited about grilling fruit this summer.  I also grow my own herbs and will be planting a vegatable garden next summer when we are settled in better. Besides that, I am an artist (but have to have a crappy day job to pay the bills, not even worth mentioning, LOL)  I really hope to have my art represented in galleries within a couple years or so, and maybe make most of my living that way.  In the meantime, ya gotta do what ya gotta do!   A bit on how I rate recipes: 5 stars:  I made this more or less as written and loved it, will definitely make it again.  I may have made some very minor changes like lowering the fat and/or sodium, subbing veg stock for chicken stock to make it vegetarian, increasing the amount of cayenne, etc.  but nothing that would change the basic character of the recipe. 4 stars:  I enjoyed this a lot but had to make some big changes to accomodate our personal tastes.  This would include completely changing the cooking method but using the same ingredients (like roasting veggies instead of boiling, etc.) or seriously modifying the amount of something (like if there is way too much or way too little liquid for my tastes, etc.) 3 stars:  This would be something that just didn't turn out and I don' t think it was my fault -- like if I suspect there is a typo in the ingredients or instructions, and I had to totally improvise in order to save it. I have never yet and will try not to rate anything less than 3 stars -- if I have serious trouble with a recipe, I would leave a comment without stars to explain why I had trouble.  I can usually tell whether I will like a recipe before I make it, so I wouldn't want to ruin someone's ratings just because I didn't care for it.",Contributor,4.8,,2007-07-01,2,1,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/fruit-kebab.png,8863

I do not use cookbooks although i enjoy browsing through them. I love to cook pretty much anything. I think though that I especially love to bake. I love all baking but especially like making desserts of all kinds, and enjoy taking them along when invited anywhere to dinner. I've been collecting, copying, clipping, etc. recipes since I was a kid and I still like to collect recipes. I enjoy reading about food. Actually, I love reading anything about the history of the the recipe or about the people who created the dish, anything that makes it more personal or interesting. Famous people's recipes are fun. I have so many recipes and cookbooks and yet I don't cook as much as I'd like. I have the best intentions though. I just read the recipes and dream...! This site has really sparked my interest in cooking. It gave me the confidence to try new things and I'm still into it! Wish I had asked my Grandmothers for some of their recipes since I miss their cooking now. They just cooked from routine (no recipes) I love to browse this website whenever I can. Recipezaar is on my tool bar right next to Google. I check the recipes daily. Yes, I guess you could say that I'm addicted.

165558,556891,https://www.food.com/user/556891,Jill McL,"I live in Bear, Delaware with my husband of 25 years, 2 kids and a grandson. Quite a houseful! We also have 2 labrador retrievers and a very tolerant cat. Things are never quiet in our house. I kid my husband that some day we'll be bored (maybe when pigs fly!). I work full time as a research assistant for a very large chemical company. I'm very active in my church and love to cook for our potlucks. They are my guinea pigs for all of my new recipes. In the winter months, we take our ski vacations. My husband and I are also hikers and I work out at the gym several times a week. I use recipes only as a guide as I rarely measure ingredients (except for baking). I like using the on-line recipe collections (Recipezaar and AllRecipes are my favorite), but my old tried and true recipe source is my old, worn Betty Crocker cookbook. I've been through 3 of them. I like to watch cooking shows on TV too. Since I enjoy baking more than cooking, I love the ""Ace of Cakes"". My 2 other favorites are Alton Brown and ""The Barefoot Contessa"".",Contributor,,,2007-08-01,0,0,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pasta.png,7376

184029,391817,https://www.food.com/user/391817,SanFranBetsy,"I am the mother of one grown-up son and two pre-teen girls, all great cooks in their own right. I learned to cook as a young child as tutor to my mother and grandmother. They both worked so weekday meals were simple, consisting mainly of soups and cassoluets, the ultimate comfort food. My mother was a whiz with a pressure cooker. Weekends, Holidays and Family Reunion are truly luxurious. My Aunt Jonna is from Denmark and her delicacies were astounding to say the least. Her cookies are worth walking around the earth for and grateful she found her way to my family's corner of the world. Jonna ushered me around Europe when I was a teenager with my Grandmother Elizabeth, bohemian Aunt Jean, Uncle Maurce, (rhymes with farce) and his and Jonna's children Lisa and Marc. She would send me out alone in whatever country we were in. Teach me a few phrases in whatever language was spoken there, and send me out on errands. I was allowed wine with dinners whick ranged from family style chichen houses in Germany to five-star dining with Flamenco Dancing shows in Barcelona. I did a lot of growing up that summer. I also adore knitting, crocheting, walking my darling Lhasa Apso Duffy, my children, my sister and nephew, both my brothers and all their kids. Every single one a cook! My partner and I enjoy the vibe of our glorious city. Dancing, food, the weird and wonderful nature of San Francisco. Z-mail me for some great spots to check out if you are visiting. My pet peeves include bulemics, pit bulls, and terrorism. One of my happiest days would be the day both my younger children decided they loved salmon, shrimp, and crab.

186781,287598,https://www.food.com/user/287598,SculptorOfHumanFlesh,"Explanation of my seemingly strange public name: 7 years ago I lost over 100 pounds and since then have continued to build muscle mass, definition, proportion, and symetry. Although I have never competed, I live the lifestyle of a bodybuilder and love doing it so much that I cannot conceive of a time in my life when I will ever stop. Although my diet is very strict, I love to cook and enjoy eating as much as anybody. Once a month I cheat on my diet for two days in a row, and I enjoy being able to make healthy modifications to old favorites that I have given up, and enjoy even more making tasty dishes that are healthy enough to eat on a daily basis. Once a week my housemates and I cook, this week was my turn to pick, and I found this website in search of a good meatloaf recipe. I registered just so that I could write reviews of the wonderful recipes that we enjoyed today (applesauce meatloaf, mashed sweet potatoes, and low fat cornbread). Thank you JudyFromHawaii, Kimke, and Sylvie! I've been dieting hard for a month, and that was one heck of a treat. I made the low fat modifications of course, but it still came out great. My housemates loved them to.",Contributor,,,2006-01-01,0,0,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/sushi.png,9271

However, I'm not the greatest cook. I burn toast all the time and this is no exaggeration. Because at home we have an electric stove and I didn't grow up with one I'm always burning things. I still haven't discovered how to use the medium setting on it. And my baking has gotten a little better since I found out my oven needs to be set a few degrees lower than recipes call for, LOL. But I've been trying some awesome recipes on this website and I gotta say that my mom is impressed and wants me to teach her how to bake... How about that. Well if you want to know anything else about me you can always send me a message.

I have a small catering company, but cook often and big, mainly as a creative outlet. I love to peek into other foodies pantries and learn from all the wonderful diverse and creative cooks out there. I was raised in a very small town, Eldorado, in Southern Illinois. My grandma, Aunts and neighbors were all great cooks, but I am mostly inspired by my Mom who always encouraged me with her simple and easy way of making everything she cooks taste delicious. I grew up eating the most basic family dishes that are still the root of where most of my ""concoctions"" come from. I love to feed people and feel that food is the perfect way to show someone that you care about them and that they are special. As my family is now grown, my boys have developed a whole new appreciation of the family meal and I know that they will take many happy memories with them throughout their lives because of our times in the kitchen.",,,,2008-01-01,1,0,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pasta.png,1298

So maybe in time (with the aid of recipezaar) I will be making gourmet meals! I live in Music City USA and I am a singer/songwriter. My passion in life is my music, and believe it or not, sports (a rare combination). My pet peeves?

201129,80664,https://www.food.com/user/80664,jillaroo,"Hi - I live in one of Melbourne's leafier suburbs (about 20 mins from city via freeway). Used to live much closer to the city (4 years back) but moved closer to husband's new job and son's special school. Was really unsure of the 'burbs but wouldn't move back into the city now. More trees - hills, bigger house, much better. Still, the city had it's delights food wise. Within a short distance was the popular ""Lygon Street, Carlton"" and ""Brunswick Street, Fitzroy"" eateries. Restaurants seemed to change weekly. We enjoyed Brunswick Street - because after serious renovations to old house, you could stroll along the street and have coffee etc wearing paint-covered clothes with plaster dust still on your face. Lygon Street's more upmarket - but being near a university - you still don't have to dress up. I guest that might summarise my feelings about food. Nothing pretentious - but to be enjoyed. Food and relaxation go together for me. Be it in a restaurant or at home. So, back in the 'burbs food isn't quite as exotic but because our area is popular with wealthy Chinese immigrants - there are some great yum-cha places and Indian restaurants. Okay then, all time favourite cookbook? Perhap's a Madhur Jaffrey book on Indian food that is a treasured gift. Passions? Wine, food, reading and creating an environment that is relaxing for all the family. Pet peeves? Negative people - people who talk but don't listen - self-centred people. Month off? Pure relaxation. Actually - this is a hard one 'coz it seems so unlikely. What do I do? Apart from managing the domestic front, I have a degree in Linguistics but have found parenting a challenge (one child has an autism spectrum disorder), and haven't done anything more with the degree. I do work - I do freelance writing for educational software. I love books but refuse to pay full price for them - hence, find garage sales and second hand shops are an amazing source of quality literature at a reduced price. Also love picking up cookbooks this way.",,,"Mount Waverley, Victoria",2003-04-01,0,0,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/burger.png,2226

I'm 100% health freak. I don't cook often, but I love to cook non-healthy meals for my family and eat my own versions of the same using low calorie ingredients (because my family cringes at the thought of not using loads of butter in EVERYTHING). I waste a ridiculous amount of time on recipezaar saving recipes that I hope to eventually make some day (right now, I have over 2,600 recipes in my main cookbook) but, because I'm a poor college student living in a dorm, I'm restricted to microwave cooking-only. Joy. - _ - I'm studying at a small private university in southern Illinois, where I'm majoring in History and English Literature. My dream job would be that of a local historian, with a focus on Mississippi River culture, but I see myself pursuing a job as an archivist or something related to historic preservation. I've also considered being a professor, but all of this is very new to me because, until my second month of college, the plan since I was 14 was to become a politician at the state level, but now I've decided to follow what makes me happy, rather than what I thought would make me satisfied, (there's a big difference).",Contributor,,,2007-11-01,0,0,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pie.png,2332

She's a fantastic cook, very creative, so of course I try to out do her the best I can. She was kind enough to provide me with this membership for our fourth anniversary. I love it, and thank you Chyanne! In response to the ""ideas..."" to provide: I live in Chicago. Logan Square if you're a neighbor, c'mon by. Work - I don't feel like talking about. Fun - playing with the doggy, Huxley, and being with my girlfriend doing just about anything. Fave Cookbook - I guess my Recipezaar one. Chyanne's mom recently gave us the Frugal Gourmet cookbook. Haven't tried any of it yet, and he's apparently a perv, but i remember watching him fondly as a youngster. (Glad he couldn't see me.) Passions - Life & happiness Peeves - Oh man... Abridged version: Idiots. Fave dish to cook - Whichever one I get to eat soonest. Famous for - Well, I'll have to go with done, but not too done, fresh green beans. Lame. Otherwise, it's something I've found here. I'm famous for following directions on great recipes. Fave restaurant - Lula Cafe. Right on the Square in Logan Square. Everything I've had there is amazing. They change their menu weekly to adjust with the freshest/most local ingredients. It's really fantastic. I know I don't know you, but you should go. If you go for brunch (or anytime, I guess) have a bloody mary. Awesome!",Contributor,,,2009-01-01,0,0,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/fruit-kebab.png,2539

Baking was and I suppose is still my first love but cooking a wonderful new dish is always fun. My pet peeves are: Poorly written recipes, Vague reviews (i.e. ""was the best soup I've ever tasted""), Reviews where the reviewer changed more than half of the original recipe the first time they made it and people that say they can't cook. I don't have one favorite cookbook, I have several ; Cookwise by Shirley Corrriher, Chocolate Snowball by Lefty Halloran Flatt, Ultimate Bread by Eric Treuille & Ursula Ferrigno, Cooking in the Wine Country by Joanne Weir.",,,,2006-02-01,0,0,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pie.png,2826

201354,454692,https://www.food.com/user/454692,chocolatelover,"I've been married to the love of my life for 14 years. I'm mom to an adorable, energetic, spirited 2 year old boy. ""What I'm just eating my jelly sandwich?"" Work: I have been a nanny/child care provider for the same family for 10 years. They now have 3 children 10, 7, 4. I work 24 hr a week. What I am passionate about: God, my family, friends, scrapbooking, christian music and books. Play: I love playing with my son. It's fun teaching him ABC's, numbers, colors, animals, singing, doodling... He amazes me daily. (He can count to 30 by himself) He knows his letter& the sounds they make (thanks to Leap Frog Letter Factory video highly reccommend) He goes around singing the A says Ah the B says Ba! He's hilarious! My husband and I enjoy going to St. Louis for Blues hockey games. Mommy time: Twice a month I enjoy a mom's group, MOPS (Mothers of Pre Schoolers.) They are an amazing group that exists to encourage, equip and develop every mother of preschoolers to realize her potential as a woman, mother and leader in the name of Jesus Christ. It is so refreshing to get out and have conversations with mom's who have been throught or are going through the same mothering challenges. We have food, fellowship, discussion groups, speakers, do crafts, sometimes play a game. My friends and I get together one Friday night a month and scrapbook from 6pm-midnight. Oh what fun! Meals: A neighbor and I do a meal swap where we each cook 1 night a week for (our own and) the other's family. It's so nice to have a night off from cooking and to try foods I may not normally fix. Favorite cookbook: Any Gooseberry Patch. Favorite cooking magazine: Cooks Country Cooking: I am trying to adapt my cooking from convience foods to more home cooked meals. Pet Peeves: People who talk all about themselves and don't ask any questions to get to know others.(You can never have too many friends)",Contributor,,,2007-02-01,1,0,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/pie.png,2904

Little by little my taste-buds has matured and I’m beginning to develop a genuine interest in wine, cheese, fish and numerous other delicacies, and I often find myself thinking about composing interesting and surprising menus. I often experiment with different cooking techniques and flavors -constantly trying to up my skills. However you should remember that 80% of the result derrives from the ingredients you use.

I have been cooking for many years, since I was young. Over the last several years, I have become somewhat of a Food Network junkie. I will try any recipe from the simplest to gourmet. At the beginning of 2008, I decided to make changes to my diet. I was interested in learning more about vegetarianism. I very rarely eat meat now, but I do once in a while. It has been hard to make the full transformation, therefore I do not call myself vegetarian. My husband has been extremely supportive, even though he LOVES meat. (This is an understatement). I try to cut out as much dairy as I can as well, but not completely, I am a cheese freak! I am interested in any new receipes, meat free or not.

My hobbies have included reading, traveling, playing Blackjack, and staying current on the latest news (domestic and international). However, I have reached a point in my life where I have developed a an interest in cooking. Oh sure, I can cook the basic Southern dishes, but I want to expand to other ethnic areas, too.

I am always on the look out for delicious and different desserts and I am always willing to challenge my self with new recipies. My dream is to start my own dessert catering business.

203738,2929686,https://www.food.com/user/2929686,tiffany,I am a new Mommy and I would like to learn how to cook better. I don't mind cooking but..... every time I try something new it usually does not come out right! I have some recipes that are great only because my mother taught me! But like I said whenever I try to be creative it doesn't go over very well. I am super excited to try this new website out and maybe I can become the cook I always wanted to be.,,,248,2013-08-01,0,0,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/sushi.png,8759

After I was married and money was really tight with my husband the only one working. Having to make ends meet with a military pay check. I have to basically cook from scratch, created and experiment lots of different food. I am so glad that i did though, because i had no idea how fun cooking and rewarding cooking can be. I was born in Thailand, but was raised in Stockton, CA where i met my husband. I grew up in a family of 8 kids, mom was a stay at home mom and also such a great asian cook. Growing up we didn't have much money, but my mom managed to have atlease 2-3 different dishes each night and great homemade meals 3 times a day. Even being married and out of the house for almost 10 years i still miss living at home and growing up in a happy and not so quit house. That is the memory i hope to accomplish with my kids once they are grown and have their own family.

Some days dinner is a hit and others not so much but I enjoyed trying to get it done! We don't live close to any stores so a lot of times I have to improvise with ingredients.. it can be interesting! And at least once a week the crock pot saves me and another time each week the NuWave oven does the trick... As a nurse I sometimes work longer than planned so dinner needs to be flexible.",,,Calhan,2017-02-01,0,0,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/face-01.png,9735

I minored in analytical chemistry in University (I guess that was a give in since Chemistry and baking go hand in hand) I adore all things crafty and making everything by hand or scratch.

We have 4 greenhouses that are heated and powered through solar cells and HEATMOR wood furnaces. We aspire to be green to the planet. Cooking is all about FRESH, GREAT TASTING ingredients.

Also getting into food photography, a little, thanks to a nutty friend. My all-time favorite cookbook is, without a doubt, ""The New Doubleday Cookbook"" by Jean Anderson & Elaine Hanna, 1985 version. My grandmother gave me a copy of this when I got married and it quite literally saved my marriage. I love it so much when I found another copy in a used book store I bought it to save for when MY daughter is grown.",Contributor,5.0,,2008-01-01,3,2,https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/gk/img/avatar/taco.png,10786
